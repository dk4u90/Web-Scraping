Over 68,000 had watched the proceedings. In October last, the Gujarat High Court began broadcasting proceedings on the internet on an experimental basis.

"UPDATED: JUN 08 2021, 01:08 IST","DHNS,",Opinion,Jammu & Kashmir’s drug problem is serious,"Drug addiction in Kashmir has assumed alarming proportions. According to doctors at the de-addiction centre of the Srinagar-based Institute of Mental health & Neurosciences (IMHANS), the number of drug addicts seeking help has been rising since 2016. The number of patients who registered for Opioid Substitution Therapy at the de-addiction centre surged from 139 in the 2012-15 period to 309 in the 2016-19 period. Even more alarming are the figures since. Over 495 patients sought OST in 2020. This figure has jumped to 500 in just the first five months this year. The magnitude of the drug addiction problem in Kashmir is likely to be higher than what the IMHANS figures reveal. Given the social stigma attached to drug addiction, most people prefer to suffer in silence rather than seek medical help for the problem. Hence, the IMHANS figures probably indicate just the tip of the iceberg of the narcotics problem in Kashmir. Worryingly, unlike in the past when many Kashmiris turned to cough syrup, heroin has become their preferred narcotic in recent years."

"UPDATED: JUN 09 2021, 07:51 IST","DHNS,",Opinion,China must come clean on virus origin,"With a growing number of scientific studies indicating that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the pandemic that has ravaged the world, emerged from a Wuhan laboratory, the need for an independent and comprehensive probe into the origin of the virus has become imperative. The claim that the virus may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), whether intentionally or not, has gained traction in recent weeks. US President Joe Biden has ordered American intelligence agencies to “redouble” their efforts to find out the origin of Covid-19. As DH reported recently, the first red flag about the possible lab-origin of the virus was raised in early 2020 itself by Indian biologists at IIT-Delhi who studied its protein structure. Recent studies have claimed to have found new evidence of it. A study by British professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Birger Sorensen, for instance, states that the SARS-CoV-2 does not have a “credible natural ancestor”, as Covid-19 samples reveal “unique fingerprints” that could have only arisen from manipulation in a lab. Their study claims that the Wuhan scientists tried to cover their tracks by retro-engineering versions of the virus to make it appear that it had evolved naturally from bats."

The Niti Aayog Index has seen the overall SDG score move from 60 in 2019 to 66 in 2021, mainly on the strength of achievements related to clean energy, urban development and health.

The system of giving equal weightage to second PUC exam marks in core subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology, and the scores obtained in CET has had to be done away with since the PUC board exams were cancelled. There were earlier indications that the grading of students would involve internal assessments by their colleges. This had led to apprehension among students. Internal assessments have an element of subjectivity and partiality and therefore lack credibility. Such fears have now been allayed as there will be no minimum eligibility criteria to appear for CET.

"UPDATED: JUN 14 2021, 12:13 IST","DHNS,",Opinion,"Confusing the virus, Karnataka-government style","The partial relaxation of the Covid lockdown announced by Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa is unrealistic and will neither help break the chain of the virus nor will it kickstart the economy. The state would perhaps have been better off continuing the existing lockdown than adopting a piecemeal approach without a basic understanding that revival can begin only when the entire ecosystem of supply chain, production and markets are thrown open simultaneously. Now, while the government has allowed all industries to function with 50% manpower, shops that market their products will have to remain shut as only sale of essential goods, besides construction materials, is permitted. This is an unenviable situation for the industry as, on the one hand, they incur manufacturing costs while on the other, there is a pile-up of inventory with the markets closed. Though the government last week permitted 100% export-oriented units to reopen, most of them preferred to remain shut because they could not resume production as factories manufacturing raw materials were not allowed to open."

At present, there is a 15% gap between the number of men and women who have got at least one dose of vaccination. Worryingly, this gap has widened in recent months. On April 10, there was a 2% disparity between vaccinated men and women. This rose to 12% on April 24 and 24% on May 6. The gender gap in vaccinations is highest in Jammu and Kashmir, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Kerala and Chhattisgarh deserve applause. Here, women have outperformed men in getting vaccinated. Karnataka has not done too badly. It has the fifth smallest gender gap in the country. There is scope for improvement, however. The gender gap in vaccinations cannot be attributed to the skewed sex ratio in the country. India has 5.7% more men than women in the population. Had the gender disparity in vaccinations been around 6%, we could have dismissed it as reflecting the country’s current gender statistics. Since the gender disparity in vaccination is far greater than 6%, there is reason for concern."

However, the swearing-in of a government minus Netanyahu may not represent a major change as several coalition members were allies of Netanyahu in the past. Prime Minister Bennett, for instance, was his chief of staff and a protégé. A shared determination to oust Netanyahu brought the coalition’s constituents together. There is little else that unites them, which means that Israel has entered another period of political instability.

So, freedom sometimes means unfreedom, democracy means dictatorship, and any year becomes 1984. That is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s words at the G-7 summit sound as strange as a different language from a different country, spoken by a strange leader. Modi told the leaders of the world?s major democracies that India is a natural ally in defending the shared values from a host of threats stemming from ?authoritarianism, terrorism and violent extremism, disinformation and economic coercion?.

"UPDATED: AUG 17 2021, 13:46 IST","DHNS,",Opinion,Governor must walk back VC decision,"Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala has waded into a controversy by appointing the principal of a private dental college, S M Jayakara, as the interim vice-chancellor (VC) of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, that too without consulting Medical Education and Health Minister K Sudhakar, who is also the pro-chancellor of the university. It is established practice that when the office of the VC falls vacant, the senior-most dean or one of the two registrars is given temporary charge. Handing over the reins to an academic from a private affiliated college is not only unknown in the university?s history, but also sets a wrong precedent given the conflict of interests involved. Though a bare reading of the relevant Act states that the Governor as Chancellor may fill a temporary vacancy as he deems fit, under the overall Constitutional scheme, he is bound to act on the aide and advice of the council of ministers, except in certain matters on which discretionary powers are conferred on him. At the very least, the Governor has broken with established convention in this instance."

The outpouring of emotion from sportspersons to Bollywood celebrities, and from politicians to entrepreneurs, in the wake of the demise of the 91-year-old, is a reflection of what the legendary sprinter meant to our country. For generations, Milkha Singh, who succumbed to Covid-19 after a month-long battle on Friday night, wasn't just a one-of-a-kind Indian athlete?he was an emotion. His is not just the proverbial rags-to-riches tale of a young man from a refugee camp in Delhi going on to become arguably the biggest sporting superstar of his time. He was a symbol of India's bloodied past, which still evokes pain and anguish in equal measure. He ran for his life from Pakistan after watching his parents and siblings being killed in post-partition riots. Once in India, he ran to live. In between, he had a roller-coaster ride. At the refugee camp, he indulged in petty crimes and was put behind bars. It was only after three unsuccessful attempts that he finally made it to the Indian Army. It was in the army that Milkha's dreams of running competitively grew wings. That said, he was largely a self-made man. He not only made light of the obvious obstacles strewn in the path of an Indian athlete of that era, but also overcame great personal tragedy to inspire many Indians to take up the sport."

The case is buttressed by law also because the Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005, provides for such compensation. Covid-19 was notified as a disaster under the DMA in March 2020. The ex gratia in such cases is Rs 4 lakh, as per a 2015 notification. A PIL filed in the Supreme Court has demanded payment of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of every victim, as in the case of cyclones, floods, earthquakes, etc. The central government has opposed the demand on various grounds, including the assertion that it cannot afford to make payment of such a large compensation. According to official figures, about four lakh deaths have taken place due to Covid-19 till now. The figures may change, and more fatalities are likely to occur in the coming weeks and months. But it is not right to claim that there are no resources when the government is spending huge money on projects like the Central Vista redevelopment."

"UPDATED: JUN 29 2021, 15:51 IST","Joydeep Ghosh,",Opinion,Why India needs tougher financial regulators,"The Indian financial sector, for years, has been facing a credibility crisis. For a good reason, too. Imagine this: Every middle-class/upper-middle-class person gets a few calls daily from telemarketers peddling credit cards, personal loans, and of course, insurance products. But they are not the only chosen ones. Even former President and then-Finance Minister, late Pranab Mukherjee, once fumed that he was getting four-five calls a day from telemarketers selling home loans. It isn't just about the leaking of the mobile number, which is terrible enough despite applying for DND (do not disturb), but the details of financial status that many of them possess. For example, someone from an X bank will happily ask you to transfer the existing personal loan at a 10 per cent interest rate to another bank at 9 per cent or less. The distrust begins at this stage.
 
And this distrust only grows over the years. Three to four months before every financial year-end, one is likely to get calls for buying tax-saving products. Many sales pitches, to say the least, are damning. For example, investors are sold unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) as fixed deposits with tax benefits. Then, when the stock markets are rising, these ULIPs are sold as mutual funds with tax benefits. Similarly, unsuspecting investors are sold multiple mutual fund schemes with the pitch that new fund offers are cheaper than existing schemes. And brokerages have been known to use investors' money to play in the futures and options markets, yes, without permission.
 
As people grow older, fears of being fleeced only multiply. There are dreary stories of how insurance agents sold life insurance policies to people suffering from terminal illnesses. The premium is hefty, and so, the commission.
 
An exasperated mutual fund manager once confessed to the futility of sound financial advice. Once a family friend approached him. She had received a hefty sum from her late husband's provident fund and sought investment advice. The fund manager divided the sum into parts and suggested mutual fund schemes to deploy the money. However, when the lady approached the bank branch, she was coaxed into buying insurance products. Unfortunately, the fund manager came to know about this misadventure after months.
 
The old lady was awe-struck by agents producing 'magical numbers' through excel sheets. You know the type that says, ""Oh, you are 50 years, by 70 you will require X crores and this product will give?"" Anyhow, the money was gone by the time she realised her mistake.
 
Interestingly, there are loads of such cases of mis-selling against reputed and listed companies. But their stock prices seldom take a knock. Why? Investors, even reputed global ones, have the comfort that the cases will go on for years in India without any outcome. There will be some nominal fine in the worst-case scenario that the firm will happily pay and go on with its business. Occasionally, there is some action, such as the sacking of the wrongdoer or even jail. But that is rare, even wishful thinking.
 
But truth be told, this is not about telemarketers or relationship managers since they have targets and incentives linked to their performance. It's more about the top management of these firms who set astronomical targets for their staff to earn a few rupees more. So there is a need to rein them in.
 
But that requires more aggression from our financial regulators ?the Reserve Bank of India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), or the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Cases of mis-selling or impropriety, as soon as reported, should be resolved fast. If proved guilty, the fines should be exemplary ?five times or ten times the amount defrauded. Moreover, depending on their history, the wrongdoer should be given just one chance or none.
 
It's not that the regulators don't impose fines or issue orders. The IRDAI or SEBI do penalise companies regularly. But the amounts don't deter mis-selling or put the 'fear of fines' in the errant firms and their top honchos. Fines of Rs 5 lakh or Rs 5 crore won't deter firms and managements with profits running into hundreds and thousands of crores. Rs 100 crore or more, though, maybe a good start.
 
Financial frauds happen in other countries, too. But the fines are exemplary. For example, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in 2020, imposed a total of $ 4.7 billion in penalties and disgorgement ?up from $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
A CEO of a fund house makes an important point. While visiting the US a few years back, he met a pension fund manager, a long-time friend, for breakfast. But the fund manager refused to eat. The reason: the pension fund had strict ethical guidelines that fund managers should not accept any entertainment, whether food, drinks or any gifts, from sales-side people. Unfortunately, the CEO was a sales-side person. In India, having lunch with a mutual fund distributor and even allowing them to pay is considered fair game, admits the CEO.
 
Though guidelines aren't lacking in Indian firms either, follow up is rare unless there's blatant flouting. And are people fined for breaking the rules? Well, that is a different matter altogether."

The 2019 ratio shows a much-improved performance by a country which till recently had a poor sex ratio.
