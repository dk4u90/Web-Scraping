A massive fire swept through two roof-top pubs, Mojo's Bistro and 1 Above, located in Kamala Mills Compound in central Mumbai, on December 29 last year, resulting in the death of 14 persons.

Judge A L Yawalkar rejected Tulli's application, special prosecutor Prakash Shetty said.

Tulli had surrendered before the police in January after the court rejected his anticipatory bail application.

The police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the owners of the two pubs, the owners of Kamala Mills Compound and some civic officials.

It is alleged that flying embers from hookah, served illegally at Mojo's Bistro, started the blaze, and illegal alterations at both the pubs aggravated the tragedy

While a charge sheet has been filed, the trial is yet to start."

The service honoring Hawking was held at the University of Cambridge's St. Mary the Great church, even though the celebrated cosmologist and mathematician, who died on March 14 at age 76, was an atheist, Efe reported.

Hundreds of people lined the streets for the funeral procession, from Hawking's home in west Cambridge to the city's centre, where the church is located.

His coffin was topped with white ""Universe"" lilies and white ""Polar Star"" roses, which were placed on the casket by his three children, Lucy, Robert and Tim.

When the funeral procession arrived, St. Mary the Great's bell tolled 76 times, one for each of the professor's life, who was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in his 20s and was soon forced to use a wheelchair and eventually a speech synthesizer.

During the service, Redmayne gave a reading from Ecclesiastes and astronomer Martin Rees read from Plato's Apology 40, ""The Death of Socrates,"" while eulogies were delivered by professor Fay Dowker, a former student, and Hawking's eldest son Robert.

After the funeral, a private reception was held at Cambridge's Trinity College, one of the university's most prestigious institutions.

Hawking's ashes will be interred on June 15 in London's Westminster Abbey, near Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin's graves.

Hawking, who turned down a Knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II, helped establish the foundations of modern cosmology and became an icon of popular culture, appearing on numerous shows and TV series, including ""The Simpsons,"" ""Star Trek"" and ""The Big Bang Theory.""

Hawking's rise to fame came after publishing ""A Brief History of Time"" in 1988, in which he explains the latest discoveries regarding the nature of black holes and the origins of the Universe for non-specialist readers.

He termed reports of subsequent events, including loaning Rs 64 crore to Nupower Renewables through one of his companies, or subsequent transactions which resulted in Deepak Kochhar gaining full ownership of the company, as baseless.

These reports have led to allegations of possible conflict of interest and quid pro quo against Chanda Kochhar.

""Our transaction is very clear and I have not done anything wrong, and will not do anything wrong...We have not invested any money in any company floated by Deepak Kochhar.

""We invested Rs 2.5 lakh, pulled it out and now there is no relation between us,"" Dhoot said in an interview aired on Marathi channel ABP Majha.

The Videocon Group chairman said Deepak sought investment in his venture, Nupower Renewables, over a decade ago. Dhoot further said he agreed as Deepak was seeking only Rs 2.5 lakh and was an ""old acquaintance"".

The ICICI Bank was headed by K V Kamath at that time, Dhoot said, claiming that he did not know if Chanda Kochhar was associated with the bank then.

Dhoot said he regularly invests small amounts in start-ups, but decided to exit this investment as Videocon discovered oil reserves which was not aligned with the business of Nupower, and returned his 50 per cent stake to Deepak Kochhar.

Dhoot said he had got to know Deepak Kochhar through his friend and IAS officer, former Maharashtra chief secretary Sharad Upasani. He had no contact with either Deepak Kochhar or Chanda Kochhar after the return of the stake, he said.

Asked about the alleged Rs 64 crore loan given to Nupower by Supreme Energy which is '99.99 per cent owned by him', Dhoot initially claimed Videocon does not have any such entity, but then conceded that the Group may have invested ""a lakh or two"" in some company, but claimed he does not exactly remember.

According to media reports, Supreme Energy loaned the money to Nupower in March 2010 through fully convertible debentures, a year after Dhoot divested his stake in Nupower.

Supreme Energy became 94.99 per cent owner of Nupower after this, with Deepak Kochhar retaining the remaining stake. The same year in November, Dhoot is alleged to have transferred his entire stake in Supreme to his business associate Mahesh Punglia.

In the interview, Dhoot said Punglia is a ""big consultant"" who keeps meeting people, and he (Punglia) may have ""lent"" his name to some venture.

He rejected any association with Supreme Energy, and added that a search of Registrar of Companies' records can reveal a 1,000 companies of the same name.

To a specific question on Chanda Kochhar's conduct, Dhoot said there was ""nothing illegal"". She was only one of the 12 members of the committee which cleared the loan (of Rs 3,250 crore) to Videocon Group, he said, claiming that he knew all 12 members, and Kamath, the head of the committee, used to have lunch with him.

Personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts, Dhoot said.

When asked about the preliminary enquiry started by the CBI in this matter, Dhoot said the agency probes every allegation made to it, including ""bogus complaints"".

ICICI Bank had loaned USD 100 million through its Canadian subsidiary to Videocon, which was repaid in full with interest, Dhoot said, and added that there were enquiries by the Enforcement Directorate in the matter, but it did not find any wrongdoing under the foreign exchange management laws.

""It is a circle of time where people face a difficult time. It is like the 'agni-parisksha' (litmus test) gone through by Sita and I am sure I will pass it this time,"" Dhoot, who is known to have a keen interest in mythology, said.

He said the diversified Videocon Group, which owes nearly Rs 40,000 crore which have slipped into an NPA, is also facing similar testing times, and hinted that it has asked banks for a ""push"" in the form of fresh loans, after which it can come out of the crisis in two-three months.

Dhoot said the company has serviced its debt obligations for over 32 years till it slipped into an NPA and assured to work towards making the loans performing again.

In a season where many a defaulter have fled the country, Dhoot said his passport has ""expired"" and he has not stepped out of the country for seven years now.

The CBI has questioned a few ICICI bank officials as part of a preliminary enquiry to find if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank issuing the Rs 3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012.

The PE has named Videocon group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unknown others, CBI sources said.

Earlier this week, the ICICI Bank board came out in support of Chanda Kochhar, saying it has full faith and confidence in her and described reports against her regarding credit disbursement to Videocon group as ""malicious and unfounded rumours""."
49,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 06:47 AM IST",ET Bureau,Services,How Walmart is getting ready for a bruising battle with Amazon in India,"When you are late to a party, you have to make a grand entrance. When Walmart’s investment in Flipkart does get announced, it will be a deal that will change the landscape of the Indian retail sector. According to a person with direct knowledge, talks are progressing towards Walmart’s taking “close to a majority” stake or a simple majority in Flipkart.

Walmart could pump in around $8 billion in a mix of primary and secondary purchase of shares, valuing Flipkart around $20 billion. It is emerging as the largest stakeholder in Flipkart, with a clear path to increase its stake and control over the Indian company in the coming days.

The Walmart deal would see Flipkart’s valuation rise as much as 70% or so within a year. And that would make this Walmart’s most expensive ecommerce investment by a wide margin.

Walmart desperately needs India, the final frontier for retail. The world’s biggest retailer, with annual revenues of $486 billion, is all but a footnote in the $672 billion Indian retail market. Regulations barring FDI in multibrand retail and a failed partnership with Bharti have restricted Walmart India to cash-and-carry wholesale only.



The small business unit reported $557 million annual revenue, minuscule in terms of Walmart’s global turnover as well as the size of India’s retail industry. Clearly, Walmart cannot ignore the fifth largest retail market in the world, which is growing at 12% a year.

“Walmart has been ceding geographies to Amazon. They could have easily made the move early when they were sitting on piles of cash. Itwas a low-hanging fruit,” says serial entrepreneur K Ganesh, now cofounder of Growthstory, a venture building platform, which is an investor in Bigbasket.

But there are three questions that have to be asked about Walmart. First, is the deal with Flipkart its best option? Second, what does it get for the money it will be spending? Finally,is Walmart’s obsession with Jeff Bezos and Amazon the right thing, given the retail sector in India has much more complex dynamics with some hefty offline competitors lurking in the alley?



A strategic investment in or an acquisition of Flipkart would be Walmart’s response to the rapid rise of Amazon. The retail giant is facing the heat from aggressive Amazon on the home front. While Walmart remains 2.5 times bigger than Amazon in terms of revenue, the latter’s pace could unsettle its larger rival. Amazon doubled its revenue in four years while Walmart hardly saw a 2% growth during the same period.

Walmart is paying the price for its late awakening in ecommerce. While Amazon dominates the US ecommerce with 43.5% market share, Walmart has a nominal presence with 3.6% share.


Walmart’s understanding of the power of ecommerce begins with the acquisition of Jet.com in the US in August 2016. They not only expanded their online presence, they also got on board Marc Lore as their head of US ecommerce. Lore has a history with Bezos. He had sold his company Quidsi to Bezos, stayed in Amazon for two years before quitting to set up Jet.com.

Reports say he was not very happy with the way the Quidsi brand was handled. And now, with Walmart’s cash at his disposal, he can set up a new strategy to compete with Amazon.







1. Walmart’s online acquisitions have really picked up after Lore joined.

2. The acquisitions structure in US is simple — all cash, some shares. Barring strategic alliances, Walmart would have spent overall $4 billion so far.

3. The US acquisitions have been small. Apart from Jet. com, they have all been aimed at category expansion. There has been no whole-scale response to Amazon’s Whole Foods.

4. But the interesting point is about the international ones — Japan, China, India. In Japan and China, the alliances it has made are with horizontal ecommerce marketplace platforms, not with single category leaders. Take jd.com. Amazon started off with a 5.6% stake in jd.com, upped it to 10.8% in just four months and then increased it to 12.1% by February 2017.

Considering jd.com’s $64 billion market cap with $57 billion revenues and $18 million profits in 2017, this seems to have been Walmart’s biggest transaction so far.

Walmart is probably realising only now that small acquisitions like what it has done in the US won’t give it an edge. “For a company as big as Walmart, for a sector like retail and for a country as large as India, China or US, these (the ecommerce investments it makes) are all tinkering on the fringes. These are not going to move the needle. By this time, half their valuation would have come from ecommerce if they had moved fast enough,” says Ganesh.

In that sense, the Flipkart deal is no surprise. Flipkart fits Walmart’s acquisition target profile and it also needs someone like Walmart.

“Money was not an issue for Flipkart. With SoftBank backing, they have access to capital. It is the procurement, the sourcing and vendor network and infrastructure that Walmart brings that make the difference.

It also helps Flipkart to explore and execute its offline strategy. After the experiment with Bharti, I don’t think Walmart would want to play a role of a minority shareholder and that is why they are pushing for a majority stake,” says Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst, Forrester.


There are clear differences, though, between Flipkart and jd.com, Walmart’s significant investment in China. Compared to jd.com, Flipkart’s financials look very different.

Flipkart made $3 billion in revenues and $1.35 billion in losses for 2016-17.



From revenue multiple point of view, the Walmart-Flipkart deal looks much more expensive than the jd.com one. Flipkart’s current base of 10 million active monthly users means they are valuing Flipkart $2,000/user. Walmart’s Jet.com acquisition in the US in 2016 for $3 billion cash and $300 million worth stock, which gave the retail giant a toehold in the domestic ecommerce market, looks much smaller compared with the yet-to-be announced Flipkart deal. Clearly, Walmart is paying a huge premium to have a slice of the Indian retail industry.

The value could still be justified if Flipkart gives them category leadership in India, the holy grail of retail. If not, this may be an expensive play for Walmart despite its free cash flow.


Flipkart’s leadership position in ecommerce is under question. Amazon’s customers in India spend almost double the time on the platform than do Flipkart’s customers, according to a September 2017 report by Morgan Stanley. Amazon’s app has higher downloads than Flipkart’s and its subsidiary Myntra’s.

The broader point: ecommerce still remains a very small portion of the Indian retail industry. It has reached the size of $15 billion (Morgan Stanley report), but this is just 2% of the overall retail market. It will rise only to 12% in 10 years’ time, according to the same report. Only apparel and consumer electronics are the two categories where online players could so far make their presence felt.

Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst, Forrester, concurs. ""We have sold the story of one billion customers, but we know that the online retail customer base is around 90 million as of now. It will be a difficult task to take this to 200-250 million customers,"" he says.

In comparison, organised physical retail in India is robust and growing rapidly, a market that Walmart is practically missing out on. D-Mart, the latest listed retail firm, is now one of the world's most valued retailer with a market cap of nearly Rs 85,000 crore.



Meanwhile, Reliance Retail Limited has been posting triple-digit growth numbers and is the largest (but unlisted) retailer in India. For the December 2017 quarter, Reliance Retail made revenues worth nearly Rs 19,000 crore, up 116% year-on-year. In the nine months of FY18 ended December, the firm has already made Rs 45,000 crore in sales.

Walmart will appreciate this scale because it owns it in the US retail market. The fight with Amazon via Flipkart will be costly, small in scale and somewhat irrelevant to the larger retail story of the country. Consultants tracking the industry say that Walmart may be going in for a deal because it does not have any other reasonable option.

With foreign direct investment banned in multi-brand retail, Walmart cannot set up its own retail stores or acquire a modern retailer. Its plans for expansion in the wholesale cash-and-carry business will bring it to 50 stores by FY20, which will keep it a marginal presence in India's retail industry.

""What are its options? That's probably why they are paying a higher multiple,"" says a consultant tracking the retail industry In essence, Walmart is making an expensive buy and its prospective payoff is not very certain. This is perhaps the price Walmart is paying for coming late into the Indian ecommerce game, according to Ganesh.

He says Walmart did not take advantage of its strong supply chain fast enough. ""For instance, if Walmart had spent $300 million to make a fairly early-stage ecommerce acquisition in India, that would not have affected them. The downside is zero and upside is huge,"" he says.

And the upfront cost that Walmart is going to make, which will be $8-10 billion, depending on the size of its stake in and valuation of Flipkart, would just be the beginning of a capital-intensive battle between two US giants on the Indian soil. Amazon has spent a substantial portion of $5 billion it has committed to India and is prepared to invest more.

Walmart will have its work cut out. Amazon dominates Flipkart in India's ecommerce market by several metrics. While Flipkart, along with its apparel sales subsidiaries Myntra and Jabong, is ahead of Amazon by gross merchandise value and market share, the fight has become tough.

As of FY17, Flipkart has nearly 35% market share in ecommerce while Amazon has already reached 30%, according to Mumbai-based market consultancy firm Praxis Global Alliance.

The big boy from Bentonville will find itself smack in the middle of this brawl. According to Forrester's Meena, ""The focus will be on getting 100-150 million new customers online. In the next few years, these companies will be looking to expand their reach across the country by investing in logistics."
50,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 07:00 AM IST",PTI,International,"Russia, US diplomats pack their bags after tit-for-tat expulsions","WASHINGTON: Russian and US diplomats packed their bags today amid a diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West, with post-Cold War tensions peaking in the wake of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.

About 50 men, women and children left Russia's hilltop embassy in Washington in a blue bus believed to be headed towards Dulles International Airport.

In total, 171 people -- 60 Russians diplomats who Washington alleges are ""spies"" and their families -- were scheduled to leave on two planes provided by the Russian government, with one making a brief stop in New York.

Meanwhile in Saint Petersburg, moving trucks pulled into the front of the US consulate as the American flag was taken down, following the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's announcement of its closure and the expulsion of 60 US diplomats.

The consulate's employees were given until 10:00 pm to leave, while the residence must be vacated by the end of April, according to the Interfax news agency.

The tit-for-tat expulsions came after Russia demanded today that Britain further slash its diplomatic presence as a crisis in ties between Moscow and the West escalated over a nerve agent attack on a former spy.

The call came after 23 British diplomats were kicked out of Russia earlier this month and is seen as Moscow's retaliation to the mass coordinated expulsion of Russian diplomatic staff by the UK's allies.

It is the biggest wave of expulsions between Russia and the West in recent memory and has seen relations plunge to new post-Cold War lows.

The crisis was triggered by the March 4 poisoning of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in an English city which Britain has blamed on Moscow, saying a Soviet-designed military grade nerve agent was used.

On Friday, Moscow summoned British ambassador Laurie Bristow, giving London a month to cut the number of diplomatic staff in Russia to the same number Russia has in Britain.

""Russia suggested parity. The British side has more than 50 more people,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told AFP."
51,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 07:00 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,How India is behind Russian espionage's growth into its transnational form,"They are Russians, and highly unscrupulous people. I — I do not want to consort with them without a witness.”

Those words could come from any number of politicians, businessmen, sports personalities and media figures across world today. Russophobia is rampant, way it hasn’t been since the Cold War, the dread presence of President Vladimir Putin seems everywhere.

TV shows like McMafia depict Russian crime networks. Oscar-winning documentary Icarus showed Russian manipulation in sports. A Russian-born academic has key role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Russian agencies apparently funnel fake news. The president of the USA may have Russian links. And then, of course, there is the Novichok nerve-agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, and the expulsions of diplomats that followed.

But those words came from a fictional character and a very Indian one: Hurree Chunder Mookerjee, the Babu in Rudyard Kipling’s Kim. Behind the picaresque adventures of Kim is a storyline of Russian spies in the hills. And when two of them appear, Kim and the Babu neatly work together, without the Russians realising, and checkmate them.

Russian spy Sergei Skripal


It is a reminder that Russian espionage may be a global concern now, but India was the reason it grew into its truly transnational form. Kim is set in the Great Game, the rather jokey term for the covert battle waged across most of the 19th century by Tsarist Russia and Imperial Britain, against the vast backdrop of Central Asia, to control access to the great prize that was India.

Agencies
Russian spy Sergei Skripal's daughter


It has been argued that the Great Game was more romantic than real, an invention of writers like Kipling. But paranoia about Russia definitely did exist. In its very first month of existence, in November 1838, the Bombay Times & Journal of Commerce, which later became the Times of India (ToI), published a detailed article speculating about the routes Russia could take to attack India:

“That the attempt will be made, even in our days, we can hardly doubt; for Russia has long envied the prosperity, and hated the liberal constitution of Britain.” Even during Napoleon’s war when Russia nominally allied with Britain, “it has since been ascertained that she was treacherously employed, by the agency of spies and emissaries, in forming plans for the future conquest of our Indian empire.”

This is the same explanation used for Putin: he hates the constitutional liberalism of the West, and its economic success, especially when compared to his own country’s wreckage of manufacturing and dependence on basic extractive industries. That 1838 article also noted that if India was at risk from invasion, “Russia is still more exposed to revolt.” Russia’s aggression was linked to its weakness, and Putin is accused of causing problems abroad to distract from the problems at home.

The British were particularly apprehensive of Russians targeting the princely states (this is part of the plot in Kim). In 1877, there were allegations of Russians influencing “Maratha Chiefs” in the heart of India. ToI carefully avoided naming the princes directly, but mentioned a report in a London paper of approaches being made to the courts of the Scindias (of Gwalior) and Holkar (of Indore). In 1885, suspicions were raised that a Father Kanovics, who claimed to be a Hungarian monk travelling to Cochin, was actually a Russian spy (in fact, he seems to have been a French swindler on the run).

Spies on both sides passed as merchants in the great trade caravans that crossed Central Asia. By 1903, ToI was reporting on the stringent checks the Russians were putting on all merchants. The same article lamented that the “Eastern races” seemed to make for better spies than the British: “Russia’s agents, when out of uniform, betray their calling by being so well informed, which is unusual in Russia, but it takes a clever, educated man to detect them…”

By then, though, the Great Game was winding down. Russia was distracted by a new enemy in Japan, while Britain was slowly waking up to the threat from Germany. In 1907, the two powers finally signed the Anglo-Russian convention, demarcating clear areas of interest in Asia.

But But the Russian spy was soon reborn in the Russian Revolution. As Peter Hopkirk describes in his history Setting the East Ablaze: On Secret Service in Bolshevik Asia, Lenin decided that Russian spies must destabilise the colonies to weaken the imperial powers, leaving them ready for revolution at home: “‘England,’ he declared, ‘is our greatest enemy. It is in India that we must strike them hardest.’” By choosing the Indian communist MN Roy to lead this effort, Lenin made Russian espionage even more fearsome for the British. Now it would not just be done by ethnic Russians, but by people of all races and nationalities, bound by their devotion to Communism.

Roy’s actual results, both in Central Asia and India, were rather lacking, and questions have always been raised about whether the real success of Russian espionage lies in what it can do — or the fears it stirs up about what it can do. As far back as 1856, the Bombay Times published a weary comment about how “Russia manages to get up periodic panics and has but to send a ragamuffin or two into Afghanistan to assume the name of envoy or spy and spread every kind of wild rumour.…”

Presciently, given that the Indian Rising was about to break out, the article wondered if, rather than worrying about Russian invasions, the British should consider the weaknesses of their own rule that allowed them to feel weak. And more than 160 years later, Russian spies have raised the question again: are they the real enemy that Western style democracies must fear, or is it their own weaknesses that allow Russia to assume that role?"

NEW DELHI: Delhi, crime branch cops questioned a principal and six teachers of three public schools in outer Delhi on Saturday on suspicion of their involvement in circulating the leaked CBSE question papers on WhatsApp groups.

The principal and two of the teachers, who work in a Bawana school, were being quizzed till late at night after following claims that they might have opened the Class 12 Economics paper in presence of some students in the exam hall of their school at 8 am, 75 minutes before the exam began on March 26.

A CBSE employee based in Sonepat is also under the police scanner since he was the custodian of the two sets of papers. The area code on the leaked ones matched those of the place under his charge.

Meanwhile, Delhi cops have received a reply from Google after they had approached the search engine for help in identifying the IP addresses of a person who had warned CBSE about the leak before the Maths exam was held. The person, who claims to be the parent of a Class 10 student, had even mailed the Board a scanned copy of the question paper.

The parent Dev Narayan has been contacted by Delhi Police and has agreed to join the probe. He told cops that he is part of a WhatsApp group the administrator of which was a man running a tuition centre. Cops are verifying Narayan’s claims.

After questioning some CBSE officials on Friday evening, officers from the crime branch suspect that a teacher from one of the outer Delhi schools might have managed to procure the papers from a custodian and intended to circulate it among a handful of students. One of the students meanwhile posted it on a WhatsApp group. Cops did not find any money trail into the leak so far.

Police also suspect a teacher could have been a whistleblower, who after alerting the CBSE before the exams had started sending the copies of the question papers through courier. Police officers say their focus now is on identifying the source from which the papers were leaked.

Two ACPs from the cyber crime unit have been roped into the SIT for the probe. Till Saturday, cops questioned a total of 53 students and have found six more WhatsApp group which figured in trail of transmission of papers.

Meanwhile, CBSE students from different schools staged a protest outside the Board’s office in Preet Vihar and blocked a road in the area on Saturday evening protesting against the retests."

61,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 10:58 AM IST",ET Bureau,Defence,"13 militants, three soldiers among 19 killed in Kashmir","In the biggest anti-militancy operations in south Kashmir in past decade, 19 people including 12 militants, four civilians and three army personnel were killed and over 100 civilians were injured in three separate encounters and subsequent protests on Sunday.

The Army claimed that Sunday was a ‘Special Day’ as they avenged the killing of Lieutenant Ummer Fayaz Parry, whose bullet ridden body was found in Herman Shopian in May last year. Two militants killed in an encounter in Dragad Shopian---Ishfaq Ahmad Malik and Rayees Thokar, army said were involved in killing of Fayaz.

J&K police chief S P Vaid confirmed that 11 militants were killed in three encounters—seven in Dragad and three in Kachidoor villages of Shopian and one in Dialgam of Anantnag. Three army personnel were killed in Kachidoor encounter spot. J&K police officials claim that locals in Kachidoor took away body of one militant, and two others who were injured severely, from the debris of the house. In Dialgam of district, one militant Rouf Khanday was killed, while as another was caught alive from encounter spot.

This is one of the biggest anti-militancy operations in a single day, since 2010-11, when militancy started regaining foothold in Kashmir Valley. The killings are a major blow for militants in south Kashmir, considered to be their stronghold and may put a stop on militant attacks for some time.

In wake of the killings of civilians and killings, Hurriyat leaders, Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik, called for a strike on April 2. The government has also ordered closure of all schools, colleges and examinations of Kashmir University, Islamic University of Science and Technology and Central University have been postponed.

“This is the special day for all armed forces. We have avenged the killing of Lt Ummar Fayaz. We appeal youth of Kashmir not to get swayed by Pakistan and its proxies here. Kinetic operations against militants will continue,” GOC 15 Corps, A K Bhatt told reporters in Victor Force base in Awantipora.

During the encounters, civilian protests spread in several parts of south Kashmir and city, with over 100 protestors injured, some of them, receiving bullet and pellet injuries.

“The frequency of protests during encounters has increased. We ask locals not to come out and protest near encounter sites. It will not stop us from conducting operations and encounters,” said Inspector General (operations) of CRPF, Zulfikar Hassan.

After killing of Burhan Wani in 2016 militancy gathered steam and became deadlier, when Jaish-e-Muhammad came to the center stage in 2017. The government launched Operation All Out to wipe out the militancy and killed more than 213 militants in 2017. Even as the infiltration continued, around 124 locals joined militant ranks in 2017 and 27 boys joined the militant ranks in first three months of 2018."

73,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 08:26 AM IST",TOI Contributor,Politics,Why the move for a separate Dravida Nadu is bound to fail: S A Aiyar,"Rumblings of discontent from the five southern states once again raise the question whether they might get together to demand a separate Dravida Nadu. The latest resentment is over the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, which will recommend the sharing of central finances among states based on the 2011 census rather than the 1971 census, as was the custom earlier.

Southern states were always leaders in family planning, boasting the least births and hence lowest population growth. Northern states neglected family planning and had the highest population growth. So, the southern states feared they might be penalised for their population success.

Population is one factor determining Finance Commission devolutions, so the southern states may suffer from the Commission’s shift to the 2011 census. The state-wise distribution of Lok Sabha seats was frozen on the population basis of the 1971 census through a Constitutional amendment valid until 2026. After that, southern states may lose substantially in seat share.

I do not believe such grievances are enough to create a serious demand for a separate Dravidian nation. The Justice Party and Dravida Kazhagam put forward the idea of an independent Dravida Nadu before and immediately after Independence. But while the idea had some support in Tamil-speaking regions, it had almost none in the Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu-speaking areas. There have always been as many differences as similarities between the southern states.

After a Constitutional amendment made demands for secession unlawful in the 1960s, the DMK dropped its demand for a separate Dravida Nadu, but kept up Dravidian ideology in Tamil Nadu politics. In 1972 the party split into the Karunanidhi-led DMK and the AIADMK led by M G Ramachandran, both swearing by Dravidian ideology. The two political pillars of this ideology were anti-Brahminism and the rejection of any compulsory use of Hindi.

The ideology portrayed Brahmins as Aryan (and hence non-Dravidian) oppressors, and thus created the highest proportion of reserved seats among all states for lower castes (69%) in government service. The 1950 Indian Constitution provided for both Hindi and English to be the national language till 1965, after which Hindi alone would prevail. Bloody anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu in the 1960s forced New Delhi to retreat, and extend the official use of English indefinitely. Agitations also persuaded New Delhi to use the 1971 census for sharing financial and political entitlements.

The high passions raised by those issues are now history. They have long been overtaken by high passions on issues pitting southern states against one another. The most violent clashes have arisen over the sharing of river waters, with every state aiming to maximise its share. On one occasion, Tamil residents of Bengaluru had to flee the city for fear of rampaging pro-Karnataka river agitators. Water disputes have also racked Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

Andhra Pradesh is still licking its wounds from the partition of the state. Both its regional parties are now demanding its classification as a special category state to compensate for the loss of Telangana, especially of Hyderabad. Southern states arguably dislike one another more than they dislike the north.

More important, the film world, which historically played a major role in stoking southern separatism, has now gone the other way. DMK politicians leading the anti-Brahmin, anti-Hindi charge in the 1960s — Annadurai, Karunanidhi and M G Ramachandran — all came from the film world. Filmstars are still very active in southern politics — Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan have just launched new political parties. But the political basis of the new filmstar parties is no longer anti-Hindi or anti-Brahmin feeling. MGR had a Brahmin wife, Janaki, and a Brahmin protege, Jayalalithaa, who competed for his party’s leadership after his death, to the exclusion of any Dravidian competitor. After decades of Jayalalithaa’s rule, anti-Brahminism simply cannot be a political rallying point.

Besides, the growing integration of the southern and Hindi film worlds has made old distinctions obsolete. Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan are Hindi filmstars no less than Tamil ones. The biggest hit by any Telugu filmmaker, Baahubali, has made hundreds of crores in its Hindi version. A R Rahman is the musical supremo in Hindi as well as Tamil films. Many readers might be surprised to know that Rajinikanth is actually a Maratha, born as Shivaji Rao Gaekwad.

The south is too integrated with the rest of India for secession to become a vote-winner. And southern states have the most heated quarrels with one another. Regional parties have a bright future within state boundaries. But moves for a composite Dravidian identity across states, or a separate Dravida Nadu, have no future.

77,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 08:47 AM IST",,Science,Chinese space lab expected to re-enter on Sunday night,"Paris, April 1 (IANS) The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that the Chinese defunct space lab, Tiangong-1, will re-enter Earth's atmosphere on Sunday night.

The Paris-based agency, which is managing the international campaign to follow the laboratory's fall, said on Saturday that the time and place of its re-entry continues to be a ""highly variable"" prediction affected by the changing solar activity, reports Efe news.

According to the agency, the chances of someone being hit by a piece of the space lab is 10 million times less than the annual probability of being hit by lightning.

ESA, which has a department specialising in space debris, recalled that at first the space ship's controlled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere was planned once its useful life was over, but Tiangong-1, which was launched in 2011, stopped functioning in March 2016.

Its re-entry into the atmosphere, therefore, will not be controlled and according to the latest calculations, it could occur between the latitudes of 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south, which includes a large part of the planet.

The Tiangong-1 will disintegrate during its re-entry and only a few parts of it will survive the process and reach Earth's surface, which, ESA recalled, is largely covered with water or is uninhabited.

The principal part of the space ship measures 10.4 metres long and is made up of two cylinders of approximately the same length, together with two solar panels of 3 by 7 metres each.

Weighing less than 8.7 tonnes, it is much smaller than other objects that have entered the atmosphere in an uncontrolled way in the history of space flights. The record up to now was set by Skylab, which weighed 74 tonnes.

BENGALURU: India’s 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) collectively have a faculty shortage of 34% as of March 2018, with only one — IIT-Mandi in Himachal Pradesh — having more than the sanctioned strength.

The problem is not restricted to newer IITs like those in Palakkad, Tirupati and Goa, which don’t have the sanctioned faculty, but also in older ones like those in Mumbai, Kharagpur and Kanpur where the shortage is between 25% and 45%.


Last month, the Union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry said it would try and make it easier for IITs to acquire visas for foreign faculty, hoping to narrow the gap between sanctioned and existing strength of teachers.

‘Half of IIT graduates go abroad to find work’

Education expert AS Seetharamu said: “Earlier, about 15% of IIT graduates would come back as faculty, but this percentage is dropping. Now, up to 50% of graduates go abroad to find work, while most of the remaining enter software and information technology companies in India.”

With the increase in number of IITs and NITs, the teaching staff needed is increasing. “However, there has been no subsequent rise in the number of people eligible and available for these positions,” Seetharamu said, adding this gap can be plugged by increasing competitiveness of salaries and encouraging graduates to take up doctoral studies as PhDs are required of prospective faculty.

While IIT-Mandi is in the best position with four faculty members more than the sanctioned strength, IIT-Bhilai, in Chhattisgarh is in the worst spot with 58% vacancies. Among the top five ranked IITs, Kharagpur has 46% vacancies, followed by 36% in Kanpur, 29% in Delhi, 28% in Chennai and 27% in Mumbai.

Experts pointed out that in newer IITs like the one in Dharwad, which has a 47% shortage, the challenges are of attracting teachers to stay and teach in smaller towns. “Just putting up an educational institute isn’t enough. Faculty members have families and they weigh options like availability of schools for their children, access to healthcare and other factors,” an expert explained.

Among other challenges facing the Union ministry for human resources development (HRD) are the attractive private sector, better research opportunities in multinational companies (MNCs) and the lack of quality candidates."

81,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 10:06 AM IST",TNN,Visa and Immigration,US-based spouses queue up for H-1B as work permits get scarce,"(This story originally appeared in on Mar 30, 2018)
MUMBAI: The US immigration authorities will begin to accept applications for H-1B visas (a popular skilled-work visa among Indians) from April 2. These visa applications are for the fiscal year which commences from October 1 (referred to as FY 2019). Spouses of current H-1B visa holders are expected to queue up. The reason is simple: with the Trump administration's decision to rescind granting of work permits to these spouses, an H-1B visa, even if challenging to obtain, seems a safer bet.

Spouses of H-1B visa holders are granted an H4 visa. They are not entitled to work or carry on their own business unless they obtain an 'employment authorisation document' (EAD), which is a work permit.

However, not all dependent spouses of H-1B visa holders are eligible to apply for an EAD. This route is available only if the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card. A draft proposal, which will be the first step towards rescinding the existing policy that permits issue of EADs is expected in June. The entire process of bringing in a new rule could take up to the end of 2018 or even stretch to 2019, say immigration experts. Meanwhile H4-EAD holders are exploring various options, which includes the H-1B route.

Priya Mehta (name changed), who holds a master's degree in business management from a US University, is deep in discussion with immigration counsels on the pros and cons of applying for an H-1B visa. She currently works in a non-profit entity and is hopeful that her employer will consider sponsorship for an H-1B visa.

Snehal Batra, managing attorney, at NPZ Law Group says, ""We have many H-4 visa holders applying for the 2019 H-1B cap hoping that they will get selected in the lottery. This gives them a fall-back position in the event the H-4 EAD is taken off line. If these individuals are able to file under the Master's cap then they are in better shape to get selected.""

There is a cap for H-1B visas. Only 65,000 visas are allotted under the regular cap and an additional 20,000 visas under the Master's cap (for those having a degree from US universities).

""If eligible individuals are not selected under the Master's cap then they are counted towards the regular H-1B cap, thus effectively getting another chance,"" adds Batra.

The demand for H-1B is so high, that within the first few days, from the application date, the quota is met. For instance, for fiscal 2018, the US authorities received nearly two lakh applications. Thus historically over the past few years, it has resulted in allocation via a computer generated random selection process known as a lottery. This makes it a hit or a miss situation for the applicants.

Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney, at Immigration.com says, ""Finding a sponsor is usually not a challenge, if the H4-EAD holder already has a job. In such cases, the employers are generally willing to sponsor them for the H-1B. However, lottery remains an issue.""

Not all H4-EAD holders currently hold a job, further not all those who hold a job are able to convince employers for a H-1B sponsorship. In fact, some are finding that they are the first to be retrenched as the employer is uncertain of what the future policy will hold.

The number of H-4 visas allocated to family members of those holding an H visa (which includes H-1B) increased by 190% over a decade. From 47,206 in 1997 to 1.36 lakh in 2017. Indians were allotted the maximum of such visas. Compared to this, the number of EADs issued are miniscule. In fact, not all those who have an EAD work, some seek it as it enables them to obtain a social security number and open a bank account (see table).

However, a group of laid off American tech workers filed a suit way back in 2015 to block the rule permitting issue of EADs. This suit is currently in abeyance as the US administration take steps to rescind the policy."

86,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 09:43 AM IST",TNN,Politics,New AIIMS plagued by huge vacancies: House panel,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 01, 2018)

The parliamentary standing committee on health has expressed concern over the fact that work on six AIIMS-like institutions started in 2010 in phase-I of the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) remained incomplete even as more such institutions are being announced and taken up for construction.

Even in these first six AIIMS-like institutions, only 38.5% of faculty positions and 18% of non-faculty positions have been filled, the panel noted. Yet, 13 more AIIMS-like institutions have been announced since then, of which construction has started in four.

In its report on demands for grants of the department of health and family welfare for 2018-19, it observed that only 704 faculty posts had been filled in the six AIIMS-like institutions out of the sanctioned 1,830 as on January 1, 2018. Only 4,202 posts had been filled out of 22,656 sanctioned posts for non-faculty positions, with an additional 2,548 posts being filled up on an outsourced basis. With this level of shortage, almost all these institutions have been taking in MBBS students since 2012. The revelation about the difficulties in staffing even central government funded AIIMS-like institutions raises the question of how the government expects to find the required personnel for upgrading 24 district and referral hospitals to medical colleges, as was announced in the Budget this year.


The PMSSY had been launched in 2006 with the objectives of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable and reliable tertiary healthcare services and to augment facilities for quality medical education in the country. Along with setting up AIIMS-like institutions, PMSSY also funds the upgradation of existing general medical colleges (GMCs). Of the 13 GMCs taken up in phase-I, 10 have finished upgrading. Another 39 GMCs taken up in phase-II have just started upgradation work.

The shortage of doctors in rural India and hugely expensive private medical colleges having almost 3,300 more seats than government medical colleges, the need for the government to augment the seats for reliable and affordable medical education is obvious.

However, the parliamentary panel was of the view that funding for PMSSY remains suboptimal. It wondered how the targets would be met within the set timeframes. The health secretary told the committee that the projected demand for PMSSY scheme was Rs 8,398 crore out of which only Rs 3,825 crore, or less than half, has been allocated.

Had the department undertaken a critical analysis of the requirement of faculty and non-faculty staff at the six AIIMS-like institutes, the issue of vacant posts would have been addressed, stated the report. Patients from Bihar and Uttarakhand continue to burden AIIMS, Delhi as AIIMS Patna and AIIMS Rishikesh are not up to the mark, noted the report.

The committee urged the department to urgently fill up the vacant posts at the earliest, so that basic healthcare facilities were decentralised and dependence of patients on AIIMS Delhi is reduced."

The NSE barometer advanced 115.65 points, or 1.16 per cent, for the week to close at 10,113.70. Though truncated the week witnessed stock-specific actions on many counters. Some of them are mentioned below:

Bandhan Bank: Kolkata-based private lender Bandhan Bank NSE -0.41 % had a dream run on first week of listing. market debut, as the scrip climbed 24.88 per cent to the issue price of Rs 375. The stock had got listed at 33 per cent premium on Tuesday.

Shares of this dairy company plunged 26 per cent this past week. While the company told exchanges that there was no strategically significant development within the organisation and business, recent additional pledging by promoters and high debt on the company's balance sheet is believed to have weighed on the stock.

This stock declined 14 per cent last week as minority shareholders were uphappy with the decision to sell hospital business to Manipal Hospitals. They believe that the deal undervalued the hospital business' worth significantly. As per deal, the hospital division will be hived off and merged with Manipal Hospitals apart from which it will sell a majority stake in its SRL Diagnostics unit to the same group.

The midcap IT firm dropped 12 per cent for the week after the company said its revenues from its internet protocol (IP)-based services may drop by $8 million. Analysts were expecting a $3-4 million fall in IP-based revenues on account of seasonal weakness. ""We were earlier modeling $3 million decline which is the seasonal decline in IP business. The additional hit will take a toll on our estimates for the company,"" said in a note.

This stock plunged 12.5 per cent last week after Goa government approved the revised fee structure for onshore and offshore casinos, which will be applicable from 1st April 2018. The move is intended to increase the state’s revenue collection from casinos.

Shares of PNB Housing jumped 13.5 per cent in the midst of rumours that parent Punjab National Bank (PNB) may divest stake in the company, which makes it an M&A target. The company has denied that it is in discussion with anyone for PNB’s stake purchase.

""Can Fin Homes has issued a clarification in this regard but it does not preclude the aforementioned deal.

93,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 10:09 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,Australia shows the way in controlling foreign funding of political parties,"NEW DELHI: As 68 nations who signed for BRI and other partners of China struggle to minimise impact of Beijing's entry into their respective financial systems, India’s security partner in Indo-Pacific Australia is showing the way by trying to pass a Bill in its Parliament that controls foreign funding of its political parties and espionage activities.

The proposed Act aims to control ‘hidden influence exerted on behalf of any foreign power’ on electoral politics. The step has been necessitated following allegations of Chinese funding of Australian political parties even as Canberra made moves along with India, US and Japan to hedge China in the Indo-Pacific and working towards robust security partnership with India. Australia which has also entered into a trilateral Foreign Secretary level dialogue with India and Japan may also participate or be present in some form at this year’s (India-US-Japan) Malabar naval exercise in the Pacific.

“On 7 December 2017, the Government introduced a comprehensive package of legislative reforms into the Parliament addressing espionage and foreign interference. Amendments to the bill are currently under consideration. The reforms do not target any particular country, instead ensuring that all Australians can actively engage in Australia’s robust democracy without being affected by hidden influence exerted on behalf of any foreign power,” a spokesperson of the Australian High Commission to India told ET.

While there has been no direct reference to China in the comments by the Australian spokesperson, Australian foreign affairs analysts indicated to ET that the move has been necessitated by the role of Chinese money power in Australian politics. “It appears from various commentaries from across the globe that Australia was in bed with China and that the current bill is aimed at course correction. Many commentaries are also of opinion that pendulum has swung the other way. But this is not the case. The Australian government upholds rule of law and international order and is opposed to any expansionist strategy. The proposed law is an attempt to thwart influence on Australian democracy,” noted an Australian analyst who did not wish to be identified. Australia is also trying to put in place a coordinating ministry for home affairs amid reports of growing Chinese influence.

Last December an Australian MP from the Labour Party had to quit following a scandal linked to growing Chinese influence in Canberra. Sam Dastyari of Iranian origin was a rising Opposition leader and Labour Party Senator. “Dastyari sparked a bitter political debate over the growing influence of rich Chinese businessmen with alleged links to the Chinese Communist party when it was revealed that the senator used cash donated by a property developer to pay personal debts. He later attended a press conference with Chinese media where he called publicly for Australia to respect China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea — a position contrary to that of his party,” the Financial Times wrote in a report last December.

In Australia both the main political parties — Labor and the Liberals — have accepted at least A$6.7m ($5m) in political donations from companies with alleged links to the Chinese state, according to the Financial Times report. Australia has has more people of Chinese ancestry than any country outside Asia and off springs of top Chinese politicians study in Australia. Last year Australia was the only country that saw protests by Chinese origin people against the Indian High Commission during the Doklam crisis.

Neighbouring New Zealand who had signed BRI is also becoming skeptical of Chinese influence in their country’s politics. Last December New Zealand’s security service urged its government to speak out on national security issues amid growing concerns about Beijing’s attempts to influence its growing Chinese community in the country. Earlier this month New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters hinted his government may withdraw from involvement in China's One Belt One Road initiative. The current Australian government has not signed BRI."

The origin of this day, filled with pranks and jokes, has no direct tale in history. However, there are various theories as to why the day came into being.

One of the most popular stories takes the day back to 1582, to the time of the switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar.

The Gregorian calendar, named after Pope Gregory XIII, marked January 1 as the New Year. People who didn't follow the new calendar, and continued to celebrate the New Year during the last week of March through April 1 were at the receiving end of jokes and pranks, a tradition that has continued.

However, other theorists say that the first mention of the day was in Geoffrey Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales'.

The day is also often linked to the Greco-Roman festival Hilaria. Celebrated in honour of the ancient Greek Mother of Gods, Cybele, it included masquerades, parades, and jokes.

Though, there is no confirmation as to why the day came into being, it is in a way symbolic, that the day which celebrates pranks and jokes, would have a murky origin.

Instead, the retailers will, for now, “optimise” processes to make up the higher production cost of BS-VI fuel since Delhi is the only city to get this fuel nearly two years ahead of the April 2020 deadline for covering the entire country.

This means fuel prices will be revised daily only to the extent required by the movement of crude and product prices in global markets. But there would be no additional increase on account of the upgrade, estimated at 50 paise per litre.

“We will not pass on the cost (of upgrading) to consumers for the time being. There are no plans to recover (the cost) from customers immediately. The mechanism will be decided later (till supplies expand to more cities),” IndianOil director (refineries) B V Rama Gopal said on Saturday.

Refineries had invested over Rs 55,000 crore for producing BS-III/IV fuels. They are pumping in another Rs 28,000 crore more for upgrading to BS-VI standards by 2020.

Delhi will benefit from cleaner fuels, but only partially since the fleet of vehicles crowding its roads are of BS-VI vintage. Rama Gopal said in spite of BS-IV vehicles, cleaner fuel will reduce particulate matter in vehicular emission, which has been identified as a major air pollutant, by 10-20% and lower other gaseous emissions.

Consumers too would benefit as the life of costly catalytic converter fitted in their cars will get extended. “Compared to BS-IV, the converter will get very low levels of sulphur and CO etc for processing with BS-VI fuels. This will make them last longer,” he said.

Noida and Ghaziabad in UP, Gurugram and Faridabad in Haryana are scheduled to get BS-VI fuels from April 2019 but will probably start getting supplies from Janaury itself. The Supreme Court had five days back asked the Centre to consider introducing BS-VI fuels in 13 cities, including Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune next year, a year ahead of the 2020 deadline.

Ram Gopal said BS-VI fuels may still be produced for these 13 cities but the logistics of transporting the products could prove to be a barrier. “The (target) cities are spread all over. We will next week examine possible solutions,” he said. BS-VI fuels can’t be pushed through pipelines or stored in tanks used for BS-IV products, which have to be flushed completely to avoid quality degeneration.

Two issues are dogging the public sector oil marketers on advancing goalposts for BS-VI. One is the ability of their refineries to make this fuel since plant upgrade can’t be rushed. Even if BS-VI products may be available at refineries, their transportation to these cities may be challenge. This is because the rest of the country will still be on BS-IV and it will not be possible to use the existing infrastructure for BS-VI. The only option left would be trucking, which will raise costs further."

101,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 10:31 AM IST",TNN,Startups,Bike-sharing startups go the last mile,"Kartikey Mishra, 22, spent Rs 100 every morning getting from the metro station to his office until a friend introduced him to bicyclesharing app Mobycy. For a month, he has been paying Rs 10 a day, and cycles that last short stretch, saving both money and time.
“I’d take a cab or auto and get stuck in traffic. With a bicycle, my commute from the metro station is faster and easier,” said Mishra, who works with a tech company in Gurugram. It’s in this last-mile connectivity gap that bicycle-sharing startups see a huge opportunity in India.

Indian roads may be unsafe for cyclists but in the past year, a number of global and homegrown players have entered or announced plans for cycle-sharing businesses — from Chinese majors Ofo and Mobike to Gurugram-based Mobycy and Bengaluru’s Yulu and Zoomcar. They’re betting on infrastructure being put in place once demand is created for their services.

“No country had the infrastructure when cycle-sharing started, neither China nor the US. The infrastructure will come up once more cyclists are seen on the roads,” says Greg Moran, co-founder and CEO of car hire startup Zoomcar, which launched PEDL, its cycle-sharing service, in Bengaluru last October. It has since expanded its service to parts of Pune, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai. The company says it has seen 14,000 transactions and is growing 50% month-on-month.

Of the 10 bicycle-sharing startups operating in the country, only Mobycy — founded last August — and Yulu have venture capital funding. Mobycy’s dockless bike-sharing platform, where the bike can be booked and picked up using an app, has raised $500,000 in funding, while Yulu, which was also launched late last year, has an undisclosed sum. Mobycy says it does 2,000 rides a day and has 700 bicycles in 15 cities.

Chinese cycle-sharing startup Mobike, which is present in 200 cities in 12 countries, is making plans to launch in India and will soon raise funds for investment in assets. “There is a demand for improved solutions for urban mobility, and bicycle sharing fits right in,” says Vibhor Jain, CEO, Mobike.

These startups aim to help commuters cover the short distance between metro stations, bus stops, homes and offices. Commuters currently have to take expensive cabs or crowded, unsafe share autos. “We are offering an alternative service that’s cheaper and more efficient,” says Jain.

MANAGING DEMAND AND SUPPLY

Some are finding customers in small areas such as college campuses. Ola, for instance, is piloting its cycle-sharing platform, Ola Pedal, in IIT-Kanpur. Zoomcar’s PEDL is available in residential areas in Gurugram, while Mobycy has its services in multiple campuses across the country. “There is a latent demand in colleges and universities. Academic blocks are about 1km away from hostels. Bicycle sharing is the best option,” says Akash Gupta, founder and CEO, Mobycy.
Of the 10 bicycle-sharing startups operating in the country, only Mobycy — founded last August — and Yulu have venture capital funding.
Big data and artificial intelligence help startups predict demand and manage supply so that cycles are available at the right place and time — a major factor for success — but it’s feet on the ground that will keep operations running. “The on-ground operation teams are extremely important because they help in deployment of bicycles as well as maintain them,” said Zoomcar’s Moran.

Industry observers say the cycling space will see some failures before success stories emerge. “Lack of infrastructure and safety is a major pain point,” says KP Krishnan of Chennai-based Cycos. “Making the cycles available at specific points is not an easy job. The operational cost is huge,” says Krishnan. Whether these players manage to figure out the right business model for India remains to be seen.

India’s muggy weather is another deterrent to cycling but the startups don’t seem fazed. Mobycy’s Gupta says their average user rides for 10 to 20 minutes, “hardly a time to worry about the weather”. Jain of Mobike acknowledges that ridership could be affected for three to four months a year when the weather is very hot but “a commuter could stand in the sun and wait for an auto, or cycle. The trend we have seen is that people would rather take the cycle and move instead of waiting in the heat”. Plus, says Moran of PEDL, commuters have few other options and cycling is about 60% cheaper than other modes of transport.

Sarika Panda, who heads public bike sharing systems at the non-profit, WRI India, says the launch of cycle-sharing systems and the development of infrastructure have to go hand in hand. “While private players can set up bicycle-sharing systems, it is important that cycle tracks are laid,” says Panda.

The startups say they are working with city corporations and local police to develop cycle tracks, raise awareness about road safety, and conduct surveys on urban mobility and consumer needs. “Either we wait for infrastructure to come up or make people start riding and push the government to build the required infrastructure,” says Gupta of Mobycy. “We’ve taken the latter approach.”

Rajarshi Rakesh Sahai, director, public policy, government relations and communications, Ofo, told TOI: “This is a chicken-and-egg situation: There isn’t enough infrastructure so people don’t cycle, since there aren’t many cyclists, the need for infrastructure doesn’t arise. Our way forward is to create awareness. If we show enough demand and demonstrate use cases, we can break the barrier.” Ofo, which is in 250 cities in 20 countries, launched its pilot service in seven Indian cities in January.

Moran agrees with Sahai and says, “It would be not appropriate to underestimate the size of this business opportunity just because of the poor infrastructure.”"
102,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:58 AM IST",ETMarkets.com,Stocks,"Money policy, macro data & global cues to steer market in coming week","NEW DELHI: The domestic stock market ended the last day of financial year 2017-18 on a negative note. However, the week belonged to the bulls.

The S&P BSE Sensex added 372 points, or 1.14 per cent, during the week, while NSE’s Nifty50 gained 115 points, or 1.15 per cent.

Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities, said FY19 will be dominated by news flow around politics with several states going for elections, which will culminate in the general elections 2019 scheduled for April-May 2019. A busy political calendar aside, earnings growth should revive in FY19 after three years of flattish earnings on account of various disruptions (GST, demonetisation, RERA, NCLT).

“A cleanup of banking system and resolution of few NCLT cases will inspire confidence in the earnings recovery story. Consumption recovery is firmly in place in our view and we are seeing some very early signs of private capex revival,” said Duggad.

That said, here's a look at the key events/developments that may steer the market in the first week of FY19:-

RBI policy meet
The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet on April 4-5 for the first bimonthly monetary policy review of 2018-2019, with the decision due on April 5 (Thursday). The central bank is likely to keep the monetary policy steady at the meeting, but shift to a hawkish stance. It will raise interest rates early in 2019, as inflation pressures build, economists said in an analysts’ poll.

At its last meeting on February 7, RBI kept the repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate at 6.25 per cent, each.

Macro data
A number of macroeconomic numbers are slated for release next week. The Nikkei India Manufacturing PMI data for March will be released on April 2. India’s manufacturing activity declined to a four-month low in February. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 52.1 in February from 52.4 in January.

Markit Economics will unveil the result of a monthly survey on the performance of India’s services sector in March 2018 on Wednesday, April 4. The seasonally-adjusted Nikkei India services purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in February from 51.7 in January.

What do tech charts say?
The Nifty50 index on Wednesday came under selling pressure and formed a bearish candle on the daily chart, suggesting weakness in the market. On the weekly chart, the index formed a Harami candle, which indicated that the bulls were not ready to lead, even after a major downtrend. “If the index sustains below 10,141, a fresh push could take it towards 10,050 level. On the upside, a major hurdle is seen at 10,222,” said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

Angel Broking expects the Nifty50 to see resistance in the 10,230-10,350 range next week. It sees support for the index at 10,049, followed by 9,951 level.

ICICI Bank crisis
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has questioned few ICICI Bank officials as part of a preliminary enquiry to find if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank issuing a Rs 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012. Media reports this past week alleged that Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot invested Rs 64 crore ($9.83 million) in Nu Power Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, after Videocon secured a loan from a consortium of banks, including ICICI Bank.

Auto stocks in focus
Auto shares will be in the limelight as the companies will start releasing monthly sales numbers for March 2018 from April 1. Vehicle sales maintained their upward momentum in February, backing up India’s revival story. Automakers reported steady growth with new models such as Maruti Suzuki Swift, Hyundai Verna and Tata Nexon pushing up sales numbers.

Stock-specific action
Many stock-specific actions are likely to play a key role in determining market direction. Ambuja Cements, Aurobindo Pharma and Bosch will be excluded from the benchmark Nifty50 with effect from April 2. They will be replaced by Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries and Titan. These replacements will also be applicable to the Nifty50 Equal Weight index, said a PTI report.

This apart, IndianOil plans to invest Rs 1.43 lakh crore ($22 billion) over next five years, as it seeks to raise annual capacity to about 3.2 million barrels per day by 2030. The company currently owns and operates 11 out of the country’s 23 refineries, with a total capacity of 80.7 million tonnes per annum.

Crude prices rising
Oil prices rose on Thursday as the producer cartel Opec and other suppliers look set to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019. US WTI crude futures were at $64.57 a barrel at 0242 GMT, up 19 cents, or 0.2 per cent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were at $69.72 per barrel, up 19 cents, or 0.3 per cent, Reuters reported. Major US financial markets including commodities were closed on Friday on account of Good Friday.

In addition, investment by FPIs and DIIs, the movement of rupee against the dollar will also remain on investors' radar."

Calls to the company have yielded rather opaque responses but it’s hard to take announcements around April 1 seriously as startups are known to pull pranks every year.

Other startups are clearly having a laugh — UberEats has announced an anti-ageing ice cream, “smooth and creamy dark chocolate ice cream that also works on eight signs of ageing” complete with a video. Hotel aggregator Oyo tweeted that it will launch ‘Oyo Smart Coin’ which will allow consumers to transact on its website and get discounts — it’s a prank. Furniture startup Urban Ladder has launched a “new product”, ‘The Urban Ladder’, a combination chair and ladder with a mug holder and a charging point. When one clicks on the link to buy the wonder ladder, it says ‘Happy April Fools’.

This year, the Bengaluru-based online seller has been clear that it’s spoofing customers. Two years ago, it successfully fooled everyone with an advertisement for a unique job — a mattress tester, seeking candidates who showed “a complete lack of enthusiasm and drive”. It got scores of serious applicants, and caused much disappointment when it confessed to the prank at the end of the day.

Ola’s spokesperson, meanwhile, has been responding to queries with the bland “We will share details soon” but the company does have its own history of pulling fast ones ahead of April Fools’ Day. In 2016, it said it was launching Ola Rooms for users to spend a night in their cabs for Rs 249. Before that, it advertised a helicopter aggregation service Ola Chopper.

It’s not only Indian startups that get a laugh out on April 1. In 2015, Tesla put out a press release announcing a line of watches, Model W. “It is infinitely adjustable, able to tell the time no matter where you are on earth…,” it said. But clearly, many didn’t get the joke. In the minute following the release, Tesla stock jumped and 400,000 shares traded, the heaviest one minute of trading since the opening 60 seconds.

Google’s also known to roll out “new products” on April Fools’ Day. In 2005, it “launched” Google Gulp, a smart drink with a DNA scanner to read genetic data, “fine-tuning your individual hormonal cocktail in real time” to deliver a customised drink. One year, it turned Google Maps into a PacMan game. Last year though, Google ended up pranking itself: it added a mic drop feature, an angry minion GIF that attached itself to emails and closed down replies, and got a flood of complaints. It had to apologise."

107,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 10:49 AM IST",TNN,Startups,‘Tech is not going to replace teachers anytime soon’,"As a founder, an angel investor and a mentor, Zishaan Hayath is a prominent figure in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem. After graduating from IIT-Bombay in 2005, Hayath worked with ITC and Opera Solutions. In April 2008, he co-founded a phone commerce marketplace, Chaupaati Bazaar, which was acquired by Future Group in 2010. While working for the new entity, he came up with the idea a learning app after realising that students spent enormous amounts of money on coaching classes. Toppr, founded with fellow IIT alumnus Hemanth Goteti in 2013, is a freemium app — the content is free for a limited period after which students pick a paid plan. Toppr has three million registered students in classes 5-12. Hayath has mentored startups such as Ola and Chaayos, and runs angel investment group Powai Lake Ventures. He tells TOI why he thinks only ed-tech can reach India’s thousands of students

Most Indian ed-tech startups focus on students preparing for competitive exams, while those in other markets cater to mid-career professionals or teach coding. What is the reason?

In many countries, the availability and effectiveness of school education is better than our country. We have a lot of children who need to learn but very few teachers and schools. The difference that technology can make in school learning in India is much greater. In other parts of the world, the maximum value for learning is perhaps in skilling those with a strong foundation. Ed-tech in India is vastly underserved. Anecdotally, less than 10% of school-going children have tried any method of learning using technology.

How do you perceive India’s ed-tech space compared with mature markets?

There are more than 400 million school-age students in India. Conventional learning is ill-equipped to cater to such a large number. As per a report by Google and KPMG, the ed-tech industry in India is expected to grow 8x between 2016 and 2021 to $2 billion, making it the fastest growing market in the world. As technology gets better, the role of teachers will change to facilitators for more effective learning, driven and delivered by learning app ecosystems.

Do you think apps will eventually replace real teachers?

There is this constant and misguided thought of technology as a replacement for teachers. Technology acts in one of two ways. One, it helps students in ways that teachers alone would not be able to, for example, on Toppr experts solve doubts for students at 4am, unthinkable without the platform. Two, technology amplifies the effect of teachers. A good teacher can now reach millions of students where he was earlier limited to the seats in his classroom. While technology will help more kids learn better with less dependence on teachers, a teacherless future is very far away.

How much time does a user spend on ed-tech apps?

Publicly quoted numbers for usage on online learning platforms vary from 10-20 minutes on global apps like Khan Academy and Coursera and 40-50 minutes on local ones like Byju’s. On Toppr, a user spends about 90 minutes a day. Younger students tend to spend more time with videos and passive learning modes. Older students spend more time on active learning, such as problem solving and clearing doubts.

What are the challenges you foresee?

The biggest challenge is going to be reaching out to the vast number of students. Online learning platforms are not an automatic choice for students and parents.

While e-tailers are battling it out on customer service and product selection, what are ed-tech companies doing to set themselves apart?

E-commerce companies are like storefronts for other brands. Hence, product selection and transactional experience is all they can improve. Ed-tech is a “full stack” business. We own what the customers get, how they get it and there is one brand that represents the relationship. This long-term relationship is the enabler for customer happiness."
108,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 11:00 AM IST",PTI,Defence,India key partner in promoting strategic energy security goals:US,"WASHINGTON: A day after India received its first LNG cargo from the US under a long-term supply deal, the Trump administration has said that New Delhi is a key partner in promoting its strategic energy security goals.

GAIL India NSE -1.01 % has contracted 3.5 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US energy firm Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass liquefaction facility in Louisiana. The first cargo from the project arrived at Dabhol in Maharashtra on Friday.

""The US views India as a key partner in promoting our shared strategic energy security goals regionally and globally, and we are working closely with India to find policy and regulatory solutions to scale up investment for a diversified energy economy,""said Tom Vajda, the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia.

""Our partnership with India on energy is a great example of the US' 'all of the above' approach to energy, which includes traditional sources like coal, oil, and gas, as well as renewables and nuclear,"" Vajda wrote in a State department blogpost.

""This LNG delivery is the first of many that will ship from Cove Point in Maryland and Sabine Pass in Louisiana as part of two 20-year contracts with India's Gail Limited,"" he said.

As Energy Secretary Rick Perry highlighted in a recent op-ed, once six additional facilities currently under construction come online, the US will be able to export more than 10 billion cubic feet of LNG per day to its friends and allies around the world.

Vajda said American energy is central to its National Security Strategy, which notes that ""exports of our energy resources, technologies, and services help our allies and partners diversify their energy sources and brings economic gains back home.""

""In other words, by leveraging the US' abundant energy resources, we stimulate our own economy while also helping key countries become more stable, prosperous, and energy secure,"" Vajda added."

The Bar Council of India (BCI) has sought debarment of lawyer-MPs from appearing before judges of the Supreme Court and high courts, whose impeachment they seek.

In a resolution passed by the general council meeting of BCI, the apex body regulating legal profession, said MPs and MLAs could not be banned from practising law but they should be restrained from appearing before a judge whose removal they seek.

“The BCI has come to a final conclusion that we cannot stop or ban MPs from practising in the courts, but there is an exception to it. The lawyer-MPs or MLAs, if they start any motion of impeachment or removal proceedings against any high court or Supreme Court judge, will not be allowed to practise in that particular court. This is the majority view of the council,” BCI chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition is planning to bring a motion in the Rajya Sabha for removal of Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra amid the likelihood of senior lawyers P Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Vivek Tankha (all Congress), KTS Tulsi (nominated by and aligned with Congress) and Majeed Memon (NCP) backing the move.

The decision was taken on the basis of the recommendation of a sub-committee of BCI set up to look into the petition of BJP member Ashwini Upadhyay that sitting MPs and MLAs should be barred from practising in courts..

The committee submitted a report saying they should not be restrained from practising as lawyers but recommended that they should not be allowed to appear before a judge who is facing removal under Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968.

BCI is also likely to take the same stand before the Supreme Court which asked for its opinion on barring MPs and MLAs from practising law.

Citing Rule 49 of Bar Council of India, the regulatory body for lawyers, Upadhyay told the court that no salaried person could practise law even if he had professional qualification and was registered as an advocate with the Bar Council concerned. “There is absolutely no doubt that an MP receives a salary from the government as per Article 106 of the Constitution,” he had said in his plea in the SC.

Citing a 1966 judgement, he said the SC had rejected a doctor's petition seeking permission to practise as an advocate. The petitioner said it would be a clear violation of rules and professional ethics for an advocate to take salary and perquisites, including official residence, from the government as an MP and at the same time take fee from private litigants and appear against the government. ""It would amount to professional misconduct,"" he said."
111,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 11:08 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,Why India has nothing to fear from rightful use of big data,"How minutely can you profile a voter? Alexander Nix, former CEO of the now infamous Cambridge Analytica, tried to answer the question when he boasted, just before the 2016 American presidential election, that his company had “somewhere close to 4 or 5,000 data points on every adult in the United States”.

The CA scandal has brought microprofiling of voters into the centrestage of political discourse, but Indian elections have always seen some amount of profiling of its now 850 million electorate.

They may not have been submitted to psychographic profiling on the basis of the ads they clicked and the movies they watched but every election, they are broadly but painstakingly divided on the basis of gender, age, caste, sect, religion and party affiliation.

Millions of these voters have determined election results — from panchayat to Parliament. It would be presumptuous to hand it over to a handful of elite data miners and number crunchers.

For a landslide win in India, political parties still can’t rely on sophisticated or ridiculously detailed psychological profiling of voters, as the controversial British data analytics firm CA allegedly did for Donald Trump’s campaign in the US and the Brexit in the UK, among others. While illegal hoovering of personal data is worrying and needs to be brought under scrutiny, targeted messaging has always been part of election ecosystem. The voter has never existed in an information vacuum.

“If social media data is considered so important, why do political parties, for example in Tamil Nadu, still use one agent for every 50 voters?” asks N Gopalaswami, who was chief election commissioner in 2006-09. “Are Indian voters so gullible that one social media or phone message will change their political choice?” As the former head of Indian election watchdog says, profiling of voters in certain formats has been in practice for decades; what has changed are the means to reach out to them.

Show Your Profile
Political parties have traditionally undertaken constituency-wise and even booth-wise caste and religious profiling and targeting of voters. Also, wooing community or religious leaders to swing votes of their followers has been a time-tested campaign practice. Further, political parties have always attempted to identify fence-sitters and spot households and neighbourhoods that can be lured by incentives, including alcohol and cash. Not all of these means deployed during elections are legal, but the larger takeaway is that Indian political parties have experimented with highly targeted campaigns even before Cambridge Analytica or homegrown Prashant Kishor surfaced as game-changers.

Traditional methods of electioneering are still in practice. Even so, the spread of social media — Facebook has the largest number of users in India, 25 crore — and the use of smartphones and high-speed 4G network have made the country an attractive destination for ideology-neutral election strategists as well as canny digital manipulators.

“The spread of smartphones and 4G to the remotest villages has given opportunities to digital manipulators to influence unsophisticated and unsuspecting voters. That’s where the danger to democracy lies,” says Prodyut Bora, founder head of BJP’s IT cell (2007-09), who quit the national party in 2015 to start his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP unsuccessfully contested in 14 assembly seats in the 2016 Assam poll. “When the BJP started using social media in 2007, it was seen more as a tool that would democratise media. Today, social media is all about trolling and profiling of users,” Bora adds.

Kishor’s team has had mixed results: while he succeeded in 2014 general election, which was swept by the BJP, and in assembly polls in Bihar (where the JD(U)-RJD-Congress Mahagathbandhan won in 2015), Gujarat (won by BJP) and Punjab (where Kishor worked for the Congress that won), he failed miserably in swinging Uttar Pradesh for the Congress. For new-age election strategists like him, use of social media has only been a small part of the whole game.

What he does is make intelligent use of data and technology to understand the target audience and increase the efficiency of already available election campaign methods.

Whether it’s the use of 3D holograms for Narendra Modi in 2014 — a mix of technology and traditional campaign methods — or asking the people of Bihar to give a missed call in 2015 — to get a voter’s accurate profile, useful for subsequent customised messaging — Kishor’s means are more tech-driven and less social media-anchored. His methods also included installing GPS in campaign vehicles to ensure that they moved to scheduled locations well in time.

Real-time data collection from each booth on election day is the new normal; it helps a political party intervene if it finds some anomaly in voter turnout in a particular locality.

But data does not decide elections. If smart election campaign could swing polls, what explains Kishor’s failure in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh election where his client Congress lost despite having a pre-poll alliance with the Samajwadi Party? Or, how could the Trinamool Congress coast to a win in the 2016 assembly poll in West Bengal despite not roping in any tech-driven campaign machinery or having a robust social media presence, unlike the BJP? No political party can ignore technology or social media platforms, but there’s little to prove that Cambridge Analytica-type of super microprofiling of voters and psychographics will work in the Indian context.

Both the BJP and the Congress have accused each other of hiring the services of the tainted firm and its parent company SCL Group but both parties have denied it. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, in a testimony to British lawmakers, said earlier this week that he “believes” the Congress was the company’s client in India. Then, a video which was part of a BBC documentary broadcast last year, has emerged, showing a Congress poster in the office of its then CEO.

The question is, which Congress victory — except in Punjab, there has been none, of late — can be attributed to Cambridge Analytica’s microprofiling? Even if microprofiling becomes rampant in the country, can the Election Commission of India, which reluctantly joined social media in 2015-16, tackle it? And, should it? Gopalaswamy asks: “Except on expenditure, why should the Election Commission even bother if political parties use any tool, including Facebook, Twitter, to influence voters?” Professor P Vigneswara Ilavarasan of the department of management studies in IIT-Delhi, who has done research on social media and its business applications, says, “From a moral stand point, microprofiling of customers is wrong.

But from a business point of view, the line is blurred. All private companies have done profiling, in some form. Cambridge Analytica is just one story that came out. Almost all internet firms mine user data. There are no free lunches.""



N Gopalaswami, who was India’s chief election commissioner in 2006-09, poses five questions on social media, messaging, Indian voters and EC’s mandate:

1. Is it possible for the Election Commission to police every message being spread via phone or internet?

2. Except on expenditure, why should the EC even bother if political parties use any tool, including Facebook, Twitter, to influence voters?

3. Are Indian voters so gullible that one social media or phone message will change their political choice?

4. Didn’t political parties target voters by using community leaders before SMS and mobile phones surfaced?

5. If social media is considered so important, why do political parties, for example in Tamil Nadu, still use one agent for every 50 voters?


How EC Slowly and Somewhat Reluctantly Became Social

* EC’s first set of instructions on the use of social media was issued in October 2013, mainly on expenditure of candidates

* Since then, candidates needed to disclose their social media accounts along with address, phone numbers and email IDs

* Candidates were bound to factor in their expenditure on social media

* EC held a two-day-long consultation on social media in December 2015, the only one till now, leading to the formulation of its social media policy

* After the consultation, the election watchdog agreed to engage social media platforms in “steps and phases” with a clear list of do’s and don’ts

* EC decided to venture into social media during a lean period when there was no election pressure

* It was recommended that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Blog and Vine could be used, in that order, to reach out to voters. (The order of preference was made on the basis of ease of accessibility of each one of them proliferation of data, number of users etc)"
112,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 11:04 AM IST",PTI,Defence,Revive plans to set up NCTC: Parliamentary panel tells government,"Citing the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, a parliamentary panel has asked the government to revive the plans to set up a National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) by building a consensus among all stakeholders.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, headed by senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, said the larger issue of national security should be given paramount importance and the ministry should take a lead role in bringing all states on board with regard to the structure, functions, mandate and utility of creating and operationalisation of NCTC as a single, unified and premier counter-terror agency.

In its report, submitted to the Rajya Sabha recently, the Committee said Article 355 of the Constitution casts a duty upon the central government to protect every state against external aggression and internal disturbance.

This duty assumes more importance in the present scenario where terrorism, insurgency and Left Wing Extremism have affected almost every state in the country, it said.

The Committee noted that there were agencies such as the National Investigation Agency, the Intelligence Bureau, the Multi Agency Centre and the National Security Guard and some in the pipeline like the NATGRID that are cumulatively capable of addressing these menaces, but there was no single unified authority to coordinate the operations of these agencies and ensure a quick response in times of crisis like the 26/11 attacks.

""The Committee, therefore, recommends that the Ministry should immediately revive the idea of the NCTC as a single, unified counter-terrorism agency and re-issue the notification laying down the power, functions and duties of NCTC,"" it said.

The panel said it understood that several states have objected to the NCTC and other agencies also might have reservations, but the larger issue of national security should be given paramount importance.

The idea behind setting up of an anti-terror hub such as the NCTC was conceived by Chidambaram as the then Home minister soon after the Mumbai terror attack in 2008 which claimed 166 lives.

However, the move was opposed by several chief ministers, including Narendra Modi as the then Gujarat chief minister, alleging that such a structure will interfere with the functioning of state security agencies and it would be a threat to the federal structure of the country.

Even though the central government made several efforts to evolve a consensus by initiating talks with state governments, it received no response.

The operationalisation of the NCTC has been kept in abeyance since 2013 even though the then prime minister had discussed the issue at a conference of the chief ministers in that year."

But several systems, critical to how consumer packaged goods firms operate in India, are yet to be firmed up. Here’s a look at three major areas still await clarity from the government.

Anti-profiteering clause
As taxes on several consumer goods fell under GST, the government made legal provisions to punish companies that keep the tax difference as profit for themselves. Large firms including Hindustan Unilever NSE 2.37 % (India’s largest FMCG firm), and McDonald’s are being scanned under the anti-profiteering clause. However, indirect tax experts point out that there is no clear legal definition of anti-profiteering in the GST Act. The Act has not even defined how long after the new taxes were introduced could a change in prices be seen as an attempt to profit from lower taxes.

Besides, procedures for how fines collected from offending companies are to be used are unclear. The biggest instance – the government has only provisionally accepted HUL’s voluntarily disclosed “inadvertent profits” worth Rs 119 crore while it figures out where the money should go in an instance of voluntary disclosure.

E-way bills
E-way bills were touted as one of the biggest means to plug tax leaks for goods transported across the country. However, the introduction of the e-way bill portal in February this year was a disaster as taxpayers struggled to work the portal that crashed on its very first day.

Now, e-way bills are being reintroduced for all inter-state goods from April 1 all over India. However, FMCG and logistics firms are wary, unsure if the portal will be able to handle the large volume of e-way bills they will have to generate, according to Anita Rastogi, Partner-Indirect Tax, at tax advisory PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Transitional credit
FMCG and other industry firms are still filing claims for inputs used in the weeks right before GST was introduced. However, companies are now under the government scanner for making inflated transitional credit claims.

On 14 March, Vanaja Sarna, chairman of Central Board of Excise and Customs, said that the board will verify all claims of transitional credit that exceed Rs25 lakh, or where the central VAT claims between October 2016 and June 2017 has grown by more than 25%. This has led several companies to challenge the provision, including a case in the Gujarat High Court which ruled on 22 March that the government cannot deny transitional credit because it is a vested right for companies, meaning it cannot be taken away without the consent of the companies involved. How the government will treat transitional credit claims is still unclear, blocking companies’ claims and GST revenue collections."

The company, which currently sells bikes across seven categories priced between Rs 7.2 lakh and Rs 1.2 crore, is looking to enter new verticals with the new set of launches this year.

""This year is going to be special for us. We plan to launch four models during the year. It will enable us to enter new segments,"" Ducati India MD Sergi Canovas said.

Elaborating on the new introductions, Canovas said the company plans to launch Ducati Panigale V4, Ducati Monster 821, Ducati Multistrada 1260 and Ducati Scrambler 1100 during the course of the year.

The new products would help the company consolidate its position in the Indian premium bike segment, Canovas said.

119,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 11:21 AM IST",PTI,Visa and Immigration,H-1B application process to begin tomorrow; to face unprecedented scrutiny,"WASHINGTON: The process of filing petitions for H-1B, considered as the most sought-after work visa among highly skilled Indian professionals, begins tomorrow amidst unprecedented scrutiny by the Trump Administration.

A strong indication is coming from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the federal agency which is responsible to process all H-1B visas, that there will be zero tolerance by it for even minor errors.

Chatter at various social media platforms and groups indicate that immigration attorneys this time expect a much high rate of rejection.

The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The H1-B visa has an annual numerical limit cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year as mandated by the Congress. The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries with a US master's degree or higher are exempt from the cap.

Days ahead of the start of the H-1B visa application process for the fiscal year 2019, beginning October 1 this year; USCIS warned that all duplicate applications would be subject to rejection. In previous years filing of duplicate petitions, by companies, so that applicants could have greater chance in getting through the lottery had become a normal practice.

USCIS has also said that it will reject H-1B petitions requesting an earlier employment start date or a start date of ""As Soon As Possible"" or ""ASAP.""

Expecting a huge rush of application beginning tomorrow and greater scrutiny of all petitions, which would require much more man hours, USCIS has also temporarily suspended premium processing.

""We will announce the start date for premium processing in the near future,"" USCIS said.

As of now, USCIS has not indicated if it plans to go for a computerised draw of lots as has been the case in previous years after receiving several times more than the Congressional mandated cap of H-1B visas.

""Complete all sections of the form accurately...The petitioner should include a copy of the beneficiary's valid passport,"" USCIS said.

If the applicant is seeking an extension of stay or change of status, he/she should include evidence to establish that the beneficiary will maintain a valid nonimmigrant status through the employment start date being requested, USCIS said in its filing tips.

Given the general campaign against highly skilled Indian professionals, the applications by Indian companies are likely to face a greater scrutiny of all these petitions. As in the previous years, Indian companies would have to pay much more fee per application than those from other countries. On an average they are required to pay USD 6,000 to the federal government per H-1B application.

And by then time the successful applicant appear before the American diplomatic missions -- embassies and consulates - for a formal visa interview and stamping on their passport, they would have to be ready with details of the social media profile, emails and phone numbers in the last five years.

On Friday, the State Department issued a formal notification in this regard which would come into force after 90 days.

Ahead of the H-1B visa filing process, USCIS said this work visa should help US companies recruit highly-skilled foreign nationals when there is a shortage of qualified workers in the country.

""Yet, too many American workers who are as qualified, willing, and deserving to work in these fields have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged. Employers who abuse the H-1B visa program may negatively affect US workers, decreasing wages and opportunities as they import more foreign workers,"" it said.

Protecting American workers by combating fraud in our employment-based immigration programs is a priority for USCIS, it said, adding that it is furthering its efforts by enhancing and increasing site visits, interviews, and investigations of petitioners who use the H-1B visa programme.

""These efforts will help assist in the prosecution of program violators and ensure that American workers are not overlooked or replaced in the process,"" USCIS said."

In comparison, overseas investors had put in Rs 55,700 crore in equities in 2016-17 after pulling out over Rs 14,000 crore in the preceding fiscal, according to the data with depositories.

However, a sharp turnaround was seen in FPI inflows into debt markets in the just-concluded fiscal as foreign investors poured in a staggering Rs 1.2 lakh crore in the segment against a net outflow of about Rs 7,300 crore in 2016-17.

Lower FPI investment in equities in FY2017-18 compared to the preceding fiscal does not come as a surprise. The decline has been steady on account of various factors such as Indian market traded at a premium to many other markets, Vidya Bala, the Head of MF Research at FundsIndia.com, said.

""Besides, fear of faster than expected US Fed rate hike resulted in outflows from FPIs in equity,"" she added.

On the other hand, a stable currency coupled with a higher post-inflation return in lay year led to higher inflows in debt. However, the situation is slowly reversing as there have been debt outflows in February and March of 2018.

The overall net foreign capital inflows of Rs 1.45 lakh crore have made 2017-18 as the best period for the Indian capital markets (equity and debt) in past three financial years.

This year's inflows have pushed FPIs' cumulative net investment in the Indian equity market, since being allowed over two decades ago in November 1992, to Rs 8.86 lakh crore.

The cumulative figure for debt securities has also grown to Rs 4.2 lakh crore -- taking the total for both debt and equities to Rs 13 lakh crore.

The capital poured in by FPIs is often called as 'hot money' due to its unpredictability but overseas entities are still among the most important drivers of Indian stock markets.

Going ahead, both equity and debt inflows will see volatility in 2018-19 in terms of investment by FPIs as a result of global trade tensions, Fed rate hikes in the US as well as 2019 general elections in India."

In its review petition to be filed in the apex court this week, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is likely to say that the SC order will weaken the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, sources in the government said.

The ministry could also plead that the latest order would reduce the fear of law and may result in more violations, the sources said.

The top court had recently banned automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

The law protects the marginalised communities against discrimination and atrocities.

A delegation of NDA's SC and ST MPs, led by LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan and Union Social Justice Minister Thawarchand Gehlot, had last week met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the apex court's judgement diluting provisions of the SC-ST atrocities act.

Gehlot recently wrote to Prasad about a review plea against the Supreme Court verdict.

He noted that there were concerns that the order would make the law ""ineffective"" and adversely impact dispensation of justice to Dalits and tribals."

In a study published in the journal Ecology Letters, the new knowledge could help protect these tropical forests and allow land managers to build new tools to predict the stability of both individual forest patches and larger regional-scale forests.

Tropical forests have been called the lungs of the planet. They soak up vast quantities of carbon dioxide, hold the world's greatest diversity of plants and animals, and employ millions of people.

The researchers, using high-resolution satellite data from protected forests in the savanna region of the Brazilian Cerrado, found that the shape of these natural forests follow a predictable mathematical relationship between a forest's perimeter and its area -- regardless of its climate region or its size.

They call this a ""3/4 power law"" and it roughly means the forests all tend toward shapes that are neither skinny like a line, nor round and smooth like a circle.

""If a forest could grow easily in all directions, we'd expect a circle. But what we actually see is more dendritic, a bit like an octopus or deformed circle,"" said lead author Laurent Hebert-Dufresne from the University of Vermont.

The team of researchers showed that the 3/4 law holds true for tiny forest fragments not much bigger than a basketball court up to large forest patches covering dozens of square miles.

The results of the researcher's model matched the observed results from real forests in Brazil.

And an experiment the researchers ran on their model shows that the fate of forest patches over time -- whether they expand or contract -- is determined by their initial shape.

Those with compact shapes of all sizes, over time, converge on the more octopus-like 3/4-power-scaling relationship, while those with skinny shapes and larger perimeter-to-area ratios collapsed, disappearing into grasslands or fragmenting into very small patches.

The telecom PSU, in a letter to the Department of Telecom (DoT), has also said it is exploring options including legal remedies for recovery of its outstanding dues of about Rs 42 crore.

The move comes at a time when Aircel has filed for bankruptcy citing ""troubled times"" in the ""highly financially stressed"" industry.

When contacted, BSNL Chairman and Managing Director Anupam Shrivastava confirmed that the company had written to DoT, flagging the issue of outstanding dues of Aircel.

""As regards to recovery of outstanding dues, BSNL could recover Rs 32 crore from bank guarantees (BG) and balance will be recovered after reconciliation of some other BGs held by us or by BGs held by Government of India or through legal process,"" Shrivastava told PTI.

Aircel did not respond to an e-mail query.

In its communication to the DoT, BSNL said that following Aircel and Dishnet Wireless filing for bankruptcy, the state-owned telecom corporation had moved swiftly to recover the outstanding amounts through follow-ups and invoking available bank guarantees furnished by them.

The outstanding dues related to various arrangements such as inter-operator settlements like call connect usage charges, tower sharing and intra-circle roaming pacts.

BSNL has said that while it has been able to recover Rs 32.2 crore, the net outstanding amount now stands at Rs 42 crore as of March 28, 2018.

The company has said it is exploring other options, including legal remedies, for recovering balance amount.

It has also sought the government's intervention for recovering the balance outstanding dues ""by way of setting off any excess amounts of the company that may be available with the Department of Telecommunications"".

Aircel announced in February that it has filed for bankruptcy. The telecom operator had said that intense competition following the disruptive entry of a new player, legal and regulatory challenges, high level of unsustainable debt and increased losses had together caused significant ""negative business and reputational impact"" on the company.

Aircel had also stated that it believes resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is an ""appropriate recourse"" given the circumstances.

BSNL's Shrivastava said that the telecom corporation has been able to port in about 35 lakh Aircel customers. As per the latest report by telecom regulator, BSNL had 9.40 per cent share of mobile services market as on January 31 and added 3.96 lakh customers during that month.

The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) had organised refund facilitation camps in field offices between March 15-31 to assist exporters in filling up refund claim forms and correct errors.

""IGST refund claims worth Rs 8,600 crore till January 31 were lying with the CBEC. Of this, Rs 7,700 crore worth claims have been sanctioned so far,"" a senior official told PTI.

With regard to those exporters who claimed refund of their input tax, the CBEC has sanctioned about Rs 5,000 crore, out of Rs 6,900 crore due till February end, the official added.

""The CBEC has sanctioned Rs 12,700 crore IGST and Rs 5,000 crore Input tax credit (ITC) refunds. Together, this accounts for 80 per cent of the eligible claims lying with CBEC,"" the official added.

About Rs 2,800 crore worth eligible refunds are pending which will also be cleared soon, he said.

Besides, states have issued refunds to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore to exporters who paid State GST (SGST), the official said.

The CBEC had late last year started refunds for exporters of goods who paid Integrated GST (IGST) and have claimed refund based on shipping bill by filling up Table 6A. While for those businesses making zero rated supplies or those wanting to claim input credit, have to fill Form RFD-01A.

Ever since the roll out of GST, exporters have been complaining that delay in GST refunds has blocked their working capital.

The revenue department, on the other hand, has argued that there are discrepancies in forms submitted by exporters with the customs department and those with the GST Network (GSTN).

Last month, the Prime Minister's Office stepped in and held meeting with finance and commerce ministry officials to discuss ways to fast track clearance.

An analysis of GSTN data shows that in a large number of cases, the refund claimed by an exporter is higher than the GST paid by him and consequently, the claims filed by exporters were not forwarded to Customs by GSTN.

Expressing concerns over a spate of frauds in public sector banks (PSBs), several experts, including Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian and former Niti Aayog chairman Arvind Panagariya, have made a case for the privatisation of government-owned lenders.

Rai, however, said that PSBs still have a role to play especially in supporting the infrastructure sector.

""PSBs have a role to perform and in India if PSBs had not been there, infrastructure would not have got the kind of support that we have. Whether it was road, ports, airport, power, telecom, all these sectors were supported majorally only by PSBs,"" Rai told in an interview.

""We may say that market cap of private banks is as high as that of public sector banks', but they have been jostling in the retail space. They have never got into infrastructure space,"" he said.

If infrastructure has to grow within the country, the needed support would flow from PSBs, he said.

Following the massive Rs 13,000-crore fraud at Punjab National Bank, industry associations like Ficci and Assocham have been making a strong case for the privatisation of PSBs to avoid such fraudulent activities in future.

Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian recently said that time had come for rethinking on the ownership of PSBs in India as part of radical reforms in the banking sector.

""I think we are now coming more and more to the view that if you want this problem (spate of frauds in PSBs) not to recur in the future, then we can't throw money in a black hole,"" he added.

Panagariya has also pitched strongly for PSBs' privatisation, saying that political parties serious of forming government in 2019 should include the proposal in their manifesto.

The chairman of the country's largest lender SBI is among those who have opposed the demand, underscoring that sale of public lenders is not a cure-all solution to their problems."

According to the contract, 30 per cent of a contractor's monthly penalties and incentives will depend on an overall score from passengers regarding cleanliness levels being maintained by them, while the rest will be based on attendance of cleanliness staff, use and quality of consumables, linen distribution, maintenance and services, which will be monitored by railway staff.

The new rules say while the attendance record of janitors which has to be submitted to the railway supervisor every month will carry 25 per cent weightage, cleanliness record will carry 15 per cent weightage, use of type and quantity of consumables, linen distribution, minor maintenance and result of surprise visits by officials carry 10 per cent weight each, passenger feedback and complaints carry the maximum weightage of 30 per cent.

""The score from each section will be compiled and weighed...Using the same the final score will be computed for the contractor every month...Based on this score, every month the contractor's penalty and incentive can be found...,"" the railways has said.

Officials said that since the standards of cleanliness directly affect passenger onboard experience, it was imperative to include them in the process.

""Also, when passengers themselves are monitoring the cleanliness levels, we will get a true picture of the situation on board,"" said a senior official of the ministry.

The feedback of passengers will be recorded on a GPS based system leaving no room for error, officials said.

Cleanliness has in fact been a major source of grievance of passengers and the highest number of such complaints are received from passengers regarding the same.

""If our feedback directly affects those who are in charge of the services, then they will be forced to perform to ensure they get good scores. The standards will definitely get better,"" said Santosh Sinha, who travels frequently between Delhi and Patna, his hometown.

On-Board Housekeeping Staff (OBHS) entrusted with the job maintaining cleanliness in trains are mostly on contract and the service is now available on more than 1,700 trains. The service includes scheduled cleaning of coaches twice a day, and cleaning at any time when a passenger sends in a request."

""... While this is a severe hit to their bank balance, it may also be sparing them the wrath of the Indian public, coming as it would have done so close on the heels of the ball-tampering scandal. It's also a welcome occurrence if it's a sign that the BCCI is cracking down on bad behaviour under its jurisdiction,"" Chappell wrote in 'ESPNcricinfo'.

Soon after the BCCI banned the duo from the upcoming Indian Premier League, Smith and Warner were each hit with 12-month bans by the national body for their roles in ball-tampering scandal during the Cape Town Test against South Africa last month.

Cameron Bancroft was also hit with a nine-month suspension.

Chappell added, ""Its (BCCI) governance in recent years has been less than inspiring, and if this latest move represents a shift in attitude among cricket administrators, then the Cape Town calamity won't have been a complete black hole.""

The batting great said Cricket Australia and the ICC must cop some of the blame.

""CA and the ICC have to accept some of the blame for the fact that cricketing behaviour worldwide has plummeted to these depths. They have consistently failed to halt the slide in on-field behaviour that has increasingly undermined the game's image.

""This is typical cricket administration - it takes a calamitous occurrence to make them react.""

The disgraced trio returned home in shame for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal, apologising to the nation in tearful press conferences.

Chappell further said, ""Cricket has been heading down a slippery slope for a while, to the point where the credibility of the game has been severely shaken.""

He said ""strong leadership"" is the need of the hour to correct this image but but none has been forthcoming.

""As always it's the administrators who either stuff up or are slow to react, and eventually the players suffer the consequences.

""In this case the remorseful players, Smith, Warner and Bancroft, have suffered an immediate backlash, but it will be the embarrassment that follows the stigma of cheating like an ever-present shadow that will cause the lingering pain.

""Let's hope that this instance of incredibly poor judgement proves to be a wake-up call for cricket overall and not just the three Australian players."""

Following requests from various stakeholders, the Corporate Affairs Ministry has extended the deadline for the scheme, which ended on March 31.

The scheme, announced initially for a three-month period starting from January 1, was introduced in the wake of the crackdown on companies allegedly being used as conduits for illicit fund flows as well as those registered entities that have not been carrying out business activities for long.

As part of the clampdown, the ministry had disqualified more than 3.09 lakh directors of companies which failed to submit annual filings for a long time. Subsequently, there have been concerns in certain quarters that action might have also been taken against genuine firms. Against this backdrop, the three-month window was provided for the defaulting companies.

In a communication dated March 28, the ministry said that on consideration of requests received from various stakeholders, the scheme has been extended up to April 30, 2018.

Under the scheme, the Director Identification Numbers (DINs) of the disqualified directors that have been de-activated would be ""temporarily activated"" during the scheme period. After submission of the filings, a company concerned would have to file a separate form seeking condonation of the delay along with a certain fee.

In case of defaulting companies whose names have been removed from the register and have filed applications for revival, DINs of the directors concerned would be re-activated subject to NCLT order and other conditions.

Last December, Corporate Affair Secretary Injeti Srinivas had said that since so many people were affected, the government felt that some resolution was required without compromising the fight against illegal activities.

""The scheme is not open for directors of struck off companies. They can come only when they (those companies) are restored through the NCLT,"" he had said.

Since implementation of the Companies Act, 2013 from April 1, 2014, this is the second time that the ministry has come out with such a scheme. In 2014, there was a Company Law Settlement Scheme that also gave defaulting firms time to make their filings.

At the end of February, there were more than 11.5 lakh active companies in the country, as per official data."

Replying to an RTI query, the central bank also said it has been issuing necessary instructions to banks from time to time on a variety of issues of prudential supervisory concern, including the management of operational risks inherent in the functioning of banks.

Asked to provide details of action taken by the RBI after receiving input of suspected fraud at PNB NSE -1.87 % and steps being taken to check such recurrences, the banking sector regulator said a confidential circular on time-bound implementation and strengthening of 'SWIFT' related operational controls was issued to public and private banks on February 20.

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) is a global messaging network used by financial institutions across the world to securely exchange information and instructions among themselves with the use of pre-assigned codes.

""Further the scrutiny is conducted in the matter and is under examination for supervisory/enforcement action,"" the RBI said in response to the RTI application filed by this PTI correspondent.

The RBI, however, declined to share further details of the February 20 circular, saying it was ""exempt from disclosure under section 8 (1) (a) of the RTI Act, 2005, since its disclosure may prejudicially affect the economic interest of the State.""

The PNB initially reported to the RBI on January 29 an incidence of fraud of Rs 280 crore at its Brady House branch in Mumbai. This information was subsequently updated and revised under the fraud reporting platform on multiple dates, the RBI said.

The central bank, however, declined to share details of communication received from the PNB on the alleged fraud.

""In view of the ongoing investigations into the matter by the investigative authorities and third party information involved, the information sought is exempt from disclosure,' the RBI said.

Among various agencies, the CBI is looking into the over Rs 13,000 crore alleged fraud in the PNB committed by billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle and Gitanjali Gems NSE 5.00 % promoter Mehul Choksi.

The Enforcement Directorate has also filed two money laundering cases against Modi and Choksi to probe the alleged fraud.

It has conducted a total of 251 country-wide searches in the case after it began the criminal probe against the accused in February, resulting in seizure and attachment of diamond, gold, precious and semi-precious stones and other movable and immovable assets."

""We have taken an important decision. Now, manufacturers will fit the plates and embossing will be done later through machine,"" Road Transport, Highways, Shipping, Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation Minister Gadkari told .

Naturally, the price of the plate will be included in car's cost and the consumer will get some relief, he said.

The minister said the new technology number plates were intended to bring relief not only to consumers but also to bring in uniformity across states as each state used to buy these plates earlier.

The prices for number plates procured by states ranged from Rs 800 to Rs 40,000, he said.

At present, the the licence plate (number plates) number is issued by the district-level Regional Transport Office (RTO) of respective states.

The ministry, which is implementing the companies law, is working to ""tighten the screws"" in order to prevent instances of corporate frauds, a senior official said.

Acknowledging that the fraud indicates larger ""systemic inadequacy"", the official said a message has to be sent out that law should not be taken lightly.

The ministry plans to carry out an intensive review in terms of the administration of the Companies Act, 2013 so that the loopholes, if any, can be plugged.

The Act, which came into force from April 1, 2014, has stringent provisions to deal with erring stakeholders, including directors of companies.

Following the fraud at PNB, the role and functioning of auditors have also come under the lens.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), which comes under the ministry, has already undertaken a study to look into the system issues involved in the PNB case and suggest remedial measures to strengthen the banking system.

""The objective of such study is two-fold -- one to suggest changes to strengthen the existing banking system and the other to guide the chartered accountants conducting audits to verify the systems in place accordingly,"" the institute said in an e-mailed statement.

To a query on whether the ministry had asked for such a study, the institute said it was taken up suo-moto in overall national interest.

A multi-agency probe is already progressing into the scam.

The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), which is under the ministry, is probing 107 companies and seven Limited Liability Partnerships linked to Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi groups.

Reports have alleged quid pro quo between Videocon Group and the bank's CEO Chanda Kochhar as well as her family members with respect to extending a loan worth Rs 3,250 crore, an issue that has snowballed into a controversy even as the lender has come out in defence of Kochhar.

It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.

To a specific question on Chanda Kochhar's conduct, Dhoot said there was ""nothing illegal"".

She was only one of the 12 members of the committee which cleared the loan (of Rs 3,250 crore) to Videocon Group, he said, claiming that he knew all 12 members, and former bank Chairman K V Kamath, the head of the committee, used to have lunch with him.

Personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts, Dhoot said in an interview aired on Marathi television channel ABP Majha.

Asked about the preliminary enquiry started by the CBI in this matter, Dhoot said the agency probes every allegation submitted to it, including ""bogus complaints"".

The CBI has questioned a few officials of ICICI Bank as part of the preliminary enquiry (PE) to find out if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank giving Rs 3,250 crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012. The PE has named Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unknown persons, according to CBI sources.

Separately, Dhoot told PTI that loans sanctioned by ICICI Bank were based on the merit of projects in the oil and gas sector.

""There was no quid pro quo from ICICI Bank to Videocon as ICICI Bank has under the consortium arrangement (with other lenders and leader bank being SBI) and which is less than 10 per cent loan to Videocon Group... the sanction by the ICICI Bank has been done on the merit of the projects and therefore, there is no question of any quid pro quo,"" he said.

When NuPower Renewables started, Dhoot said he had invested around Rs 2.5 lakh in the company but immediately sold the entire investment.

He also denied reports that his group had invested Rs 64 crore in NuPower Renewables. ""This is not correct and we deny as we have not invested Rs 64 crore in FCD (fully convertible debentures) of NuPower Renewables,"" he said and also denied allegations of transferring around Rs 325 crore from Mauritius route to Deepak Kochhar's company.

In his interview to the channel, Dhoot said he had agreed to invest Rs 2.5 lakh in Nupower Renewables as Deepak Kochhar was an ""old acquaintance"".

ICICI Bank was headed by K V Kamath at that time, Dhoot said, claiming that he did not know if Chanda Kochhar was associated with the bank then.

According to Dhoot, he got to know Deepak Kochhar through his friend and IAS officer, former Maharashtra chief secretary Sharad Upasani. He had no contact with either Deepak Kochhar or Chanda Kochhar after the return of the stake, he said.

ICICI Bank had loaned USD 100 million through its Canadian subsidiary to Videocon, which was repaid in full with interest, Dhoot said, adding that there were enquiries by the Enforcement Directorate in the matter, but it did not find any wrongdoing under the foreign exchange management laws.

""It is a circle of time where people face a difficult time. It is like the 'agni-pariksha' (litmus test) gone through by Sita and I am sure I will pass it this time,"" said Dhoot, who is known to have a keen interest in mythology."

""After the successful long-duration firings, the communication from the satellite was lost when it (satellite) was on course for the final firing (to place the satellite in its final geostationary orbit), scheduled for April 1 (Sunday),"" the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said in a statement.

The satellite was to be placed in its intended orbit 36,000 km above ground level after manoeuvres from the space agency's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan in Karnataka, about 180 km from Bengaluru.

""Efforts are underway to establish the link with the satellite,"" said the statement.

After a copybook launch from ISRO's spaceport in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh, the GSLV-MkII had deployed the satellite in a geosynchronous transfer orbit on March 29 after which it had to be placed in its final geostationary orbit through three orbit raising manoeuvres.

Only after the communication link is re-established, the satellite can be placed in its intended orbit.

With a life span of 10 years, the satellite weighing over 2,000 kg was meant to provide platform for developing technologies that could be useful in satellite based mobile communication applications.

Complementing the GSAT-6 that was launched earlier in 2015, the GSAT-6A was to help provide the technologies for point-to-point communication.

India is among the few countries to have a law requiring a large number of companies to mandatorily spend a portion of their profits on CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities.

The law is just about four years old and even some large corporates are not able to meet the mandated 2 per cent of profit towards CSR spending, but the trend is catching up fast and several companies have come up with innovative ideas to meet these goals.

This has also opened up opportunities for some startups who are seeking to attract CSR funds for various social causes.

Saira Aslam, a journalist-turned-entrepreneur and founder of 'D For Darzi', for example feels the traditional tailoring sector is one of the largely untouched areas so far and needs the much-needed boost of the CSR funds.

Among major corporates, global retail giant Walmart's Sustainable Trade Initiative supports cotton producers in India in adopting better cotton production principles by reducing use of water in cotton production, reducing use and impact of pesticides, improving soil health and biodiversity and promoting fair wages.

So far, the program has trained 60,000 farmers, including 4,922 women, while the Walmart Foundation provided a grant of USD 650,000.

According to Walmart India, its other CSR initiatives include Agribusiness Systems International Sunhara Prayas Project, which focused on empowering women with a grant of USD 1 million from the Walmart Foundation.

Besides, its TechnoServe project empowered farmers by upgrading farming practices and developing the local logistics connecting farmers to the formal retail sector, among various other initiatives.

Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt Ltd, on the other hand, recently celebrated the National Safety Week 2018 with more than 350 truck drivers.

Besides sensitising them about safe driving, the campaign also informed the truck drivers about ill-effects of drunken driving while two 'nukkad nataks' (street plays) were organised for them.

Last month, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India also started an exclusive initiative for female riders where more than 10,000 women across 12 cities in India took the 'HelmetOnLifeOn' pledge.

The International Women's Day last month also saw the World Bank Group's IFC (International Finance Corporation) together with leading stock exchange BSE organising an event titled 'Ring the Bell for Gender Equality'. The campaign called upon businesses everywhere to advance women empowerment and gender equality.

Aslam's venture seeks to cater to the poor tailoring community across the Indian subcontinent and will soon launch its e-commerce platform to make custom tailoring affordable and easy to order.

Aslam said people spend big amounts for buying a designer sari or suit, but the profit might not be passed on to the weaver or tailor who worked extremely hard on it.

Besides, tailors in big cities get much more than those in smaller cities, while those in export houses or manufacturing hubs end up working very long hours and under inhospitable conditions.

""We at D For Darzi want to link CSR activities of firms to uplift the poor tailoring community of the Indian subcontinent by identifying and partnering with them through local NGOs.

""We want to revolutionise the CSR architecture by passing on regular jobs to these tailors and also ensuring a minimum profit percentage,"" she said.

D For Darzi also plans to conduct training for tailors to better understand custom tailoring and popularise it over factory-style stitching.

""This would also make custom tailoring affordable for the public and ensure a win-win situation for all. We look forward to collaborate with firms for such CSR activities and campaigns.

""For the recent photo shoot for our website, we also shattered stereotypical notions of the body type of models and roped in common people instead who had 'real' bodies. Hence, we are trying to address social issues that we have become so conditioned to that we don't even realise they exist,"" Aslam said."

152,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 02:27 PM IST",TOI Contributor,Politics,"View: More jobs, please! Indian youth don’t want to be just pakodawallas","A Twitter survey was conducted on India’s job situation — informal, not scientific, usual disclaimers apply — on my account. More than 20,000 people participated. Two questions were asked. One, how difficult is it for an average graduate to get a job? A whopping 87% said it was difficult to very difficult. If this is the situation for college graduates, one can only imagine what is happening to those less qualified.

The second question: what is the starting salary expectation for an average graduate? Around 61% said they expected between Rs 5,000-15,000 a month. These are the results of a Twitter survey conducted in English and answered by a relatively sophisticated audience.

To say the situation is dire is no exaggeration. According to a McKinsey report, even when India’s GDP grew over 7% per annum during 2013-15, job growth was only 1.7%. As an example, Kanpur Municipal Corporation was flooded with 7 lakh applications for 3,275 safai karamchari vacancies; 5 lakh of them were graduates and postgraduates. Last month, the railways got 2 crore applications for less than one lakh lower level Group C and D jobs.

When I travel across India, I find several youths looking for appropriate jobs. Many educated youngsters continue to live with their parents, spending their day on smartphones, watching YouTube videos and on social networks. They aspire to jobs that are just not there. Whatever the government might think, they are not happy just to be ‘pakodawallas.’ Media, advertisers, internet access and exaggerated poll promises have created enormous, unfulfillable aspirations. There is a real risk that this disillusionment will morph into frustration and anger that could lead to more crime and unrest.

There are several reasons for this job crisis. One is automation, which is beyond anyone’s immediate control. For instance, online shopping is killing retail employment; online banking and ATMs are killing bank branch jobs; travel apps are ending travel agent jobs, and so on. The only action a country can take is to create a society that rewards cutting-edge innovation. This ensures that even if new technology kills jobs, we are on top of it and can benefit from the new jobs technology creates. However, considering we reward dynasts and crony capitalists, this is highly unlikely.

A society that rewards innovation is built very differently. It involves personal freedom and a level playing field. We don’t even have a playing field, forget a level one. This brings us to factors we can control, and need to work on, to change the job scenario.

We have failed in three main areas. One, we have messed up the government-private sector relationship. Deep down, our netas and babus love it when a billionaire comes to them with folded hands. It’s something to feel good about: ‘Dekha, itna ameer aadmi bhi mere aage jhukta hai (even such a rich man bows before me)’.

This sense of importance among those in power has led to a horrible government-private sector equation. There are laws in India that can be used to harass business owners, and they’re applied selectively.

In recent years, this relationship has become worse. Demonetisation and GST created a fear in business owners that ‘they’re out to get us’. This makes them think a hundred times before making big investments. For instance, realty is in shambles. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, necessary in some form, is onerous on builders. Taxes are too high. A buyer who’s paid for a flat with after-tax income, now also pays GST, not to mention stamp duty. How can a sector thrive like this? The main sufferers are job seekers as no jobs will be created.

Second, our manufacturing hasn’t taken off. The Make in India campaign has not worked. The failure to pass the land acquisition bill (remember that?) is a big factor. Unless it becomes easy to set up factories in interior India, jobs will not reach there.

The third area is education. While lack of jobs is one part of the problem, lack of trained students is the other. As aspirations to be ‘well-educated’ rose, dubious colleges mushroomed. You can see them on any national highway. The government’s decision not to allow ‘for profit’ and foreign universities has had the effect of shady guys ruling the sector. If we churn out useless graduates by design, is it any surprise that industry doesn’t want them?

Overall, we need a real set of reforms where the government steps back and lets the private sector grow and breathe. Also, the education system has to be rejigged to create incentives for blue-chip corporates and top academics to get into education, and get the shady guys out.

A job is not just a way to feed our stomachs. It can be a big part of a person’s identity. If we can’t provide jobs for our new generation, we would have failed as a nation. India’s young people deserve better.

153,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 02:29 PM IST",ET Bureau,Cons. Products,"Whoever buys Horlicks must reckon with better informed consumers in a Rs 7,000 crore market","Renuka Gupta, who recalls her “childhood days of religiously gulping a glass of one of the top malt-based drinks daily,” doesn’t believe in passing on the “irrational legacy”. “I didn’t let my sixyear-old daughter get hooked to any such drink,” says Gupta, a senior secondary science teacher at a public school in Delhi.

Though her parents, she says, were gullible enough to believe that such drinks make kids stronger, healthier and intelligent, Gupta claims to be more aware. “Growth of brain and height is not linked to any drink,” she says.

Gupta is not alone in shunning malt-based drink brands. This led to the volume growth in the health food drinks segment reaching -6.8% in 2016-17. But what is most alarming, perhaps, is another grim statistic: the fall in volume in this category happens to be the first in a decade in India.

GSK Consumer, the maker of and , has grown at a slow pace in an already slow growing category, highlighted a Motilal Oswal report released in February.

A steep fall in the prospects of the estimated Rs 7,000 crore health food drinks (HFD) segment might turn out to be the biggest challenge for the new owner of the 144-year-old heritage brand, which was put on the block by the UK-based GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as it hunts for funds to buy out Novartis in their global consumer healthcare joint venture.

“Horlicks is a terrific brand with a long history, especially in India,” said GSK Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley at an investors’ meet last week. “But in the context of funding for this (Novartis) transaction and our desire to increase focus on our overthe-counter and oral health portfolios, as well as other group capital allocation priorities, it makes sense for us to review it.” GSK holds 72.5% in its Indian subsidiary, .

Though the prized catch would bring huge gains for the buyer — brands being reviewed amounted to sales of approximately £550 million in 2017, most of which were from Horlicks in India — the challenge is equally daunting: reviving a segment that has been on a slide for three years. The past three years, reckon analysts tracking the segment, has been challenging for most HFD players in India. Apart from intense competition, rising popularity of substitute products such as syrups has also affected growth, says Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Financial Services. Add to it demonetisation, the goods and services tax and a slowdown in urban and rural economy, and the picture has been bleak for players in the sector.

Roy, however, is quick to point out that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. The companies, he says, need to focus on health, rather than taste. Over the past few years, Horlicks has been bullish on taste. “But a lot of people would prefer a chocolate syrup for its taste to Horlicks,” says Roy. “Horlicks is too expensive in rural areas.

You can’t get urban margins in a rural area.” The company needs to explore the option of operating with smaller unit packs and sachets in the range of Rs 10-20 to tap the lower end of India’s population, which is highly nutrition deficient. “If innovation is not there in FMCG (), growth rate comes down drastically,” he adds.

A GSK spokesperson, while conceding that the FMCG sector was hit due to demonetisation and the GST, asserts things are back on track. “In the last three months, the category grew 7.2% and Horlicks grew 10.5%,” the spokesperson claims, adding that Horlicks continues to remain the market leader. With Horlicks and its extensions constituting about 75% of GSK Consumer’s revenues in India, it goes on to demonstrate that customers have faith and trust in the company’s brands within the competitive market dynamics, the spokesperson says.

“We are confident that with focus on higher science, innovation, accessibility of our products and sharp customer insights, we will continue to stay ahead in the category,” the spokesperson adds.

FMCG traits, reckon marketing experts, are the need of the hour for Horlicks. “In many ways, Horlicks needs the mentoring of a company that has FMCG in its DNA,” says brand strategist Harish Bijoor. Whoever buys the brand is going to look at a complete brand refresh. And that can only be good for Horlicks, which is the leader in a category that is seeing a shrinkage in Volume and zing. Category leader brands can only grow exponentially if the segment grows exponentially. “Creating category growth must be the first ambition of the new owner er,” adds Bijoor.

Pushing category growth is easier said than done. Reason: the key driver of this category, parents,are making informed choices, say nutritionists. Parents are increasingly looking for healthier alternatives. “Most of these so-called proprietary drinks have maltodextrin, sugar and milk protein added, which don’t make much of a value-add,” says Priyanka Rohatgi, chief clinical nutritionist and head of dietetics department at Apollo Hospitals in Bengaluru. With child obesity rising, additional calories in the form of sugar and maltodextrin is not a great idea. A, the doctor explains, is worth it if it can offer something that milk does not have. “We would be happy prescribing a product which has more Vitamin D,more DHA and more choline.”

What’s also adding to the woes of players like Horlicks and Bournvita is competition from an unexpected quarter: PediaSure. The brand from Abbott has been the sole bright spot in the HFD category. It has even eaten into the market share of top HFD players says the Motilal Oswal report.


When brands like Horlicks and Complan were talking to mothers of the world, PediaS ure smartly took a different route to reach the moms: paediatricians. “Tough fight, most of the time, does not come from predictable rivals but unforeseen ones,” says Ashita Aggarwal, head of marketing at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research. An upstart like PediaSure has become the David fighting the Goliaths of the HFD in India, she says, adding that startups offering health foods and snacking options have also made a dent in the fortunes of HFD players.

Take, for instance, Delhi-based packaged food brand Slurrp Farm, which focuses on healthy breakfast and snack products for children. The start-up claims it makes preservative-free products such as cereals, cook-ies, pancakes and dosa using ingredients like ragi. Start ed in October 2016, Slurrp Farm quickly roped in 1,000 customers in the first month, and recently tied up with 300 grocery stores in the National Capital Region. “I feel the shopping behaviour is changing,” says Shauravi Malik, cofounder of Slurrp Farm, which services 5,000 customers a month.

Parents are paying more attention to product labels. “We wanted to create preservative-free alternatives using whole grains, normal amount of sugar and healthy fats,” she adds. Though the going might seem tough, GSK has been doing its bit to claw back its market share. It is looking to be more rational on pricing and also to focus on sachets. Though the sachet category is 10% of sales, it acts as a great introductory incentive to a category that still has under 40% penetration across the country, points out the Motilal Oswal report. A massive distribution reach of over 3 million out-lets gives GSK an enviable position to leverage on new launches. “The brand just needs a reboot, and hunting for new owner comes at a right time,” says Aggarwal.

Can Horlicks -which according to Walmsley of GSK has for a long time been a winning and performing brand, primarily in India- live up to its promise? Well, that will depend on the kind of drink the new owner comes up with.


The health food drinks (HFD) category, which contributes 94% of GSK Consumer’s sales and where the company has over 65% market share, is under stress. For the first time in over a decade, HFD volumes witnessed a fall in growth of 6.8% in fiscal 2017.

Earlier, lack of availability of milk in south and east India was the reason for the growth of Horlicks in the country. However, milk availability has improved substantially over the past decades.

HFDs were used as flavouring agents to mask the poor quality of milk. Better milk has reduced the need for HFDs.

HFDs were used to get kids to drink milk. There is now a growing preference to have cereals with milk, so parents don’t bother about HFDs.

While companies like Mondelez (parent of Cadbury) have been successful in turning chocolates and confectionary suitable for all ages, GSK Consumer, Heinz (Complan) and even Mondelez (Bournvita) lose their core consumers once they turn 13 years old.


: When commodity prices were benign, gross margins were significantly above long-term average and volumes were poor, there was no need to hike price in FY15 and FY16.

: Sachets are less than 10% of sales. Category penetration is low at less than 40%. Roll-out of Women’s Horlicks, Mothers’ Horlicks and Horlicks Lite has been too late and their contribution is still small.

: GSK Consumer has been losing market share over the past few quarters, which means that it has grown at a slow pace in the already slowgrowing category.

: The annual report of the parent company attributes fall in the growth of nutrition business to sale of Nigeria beverages business and implementation of the GST."

However, the official did not elaborate on investment plans of the company.

According to industry estimates, a sum of around Rs 5 crore is required to install 1 MW solar project.

""...if you look beyond 2050 the way renewable is coming as a citizen it should be our priority we must switch over to renewables because the global warning is somewhere or the other affecting each and everyone... We must be prepared for it,"" he said.

Today coal-based power is the cheapest. Renewable naturally will be costly. But the ways work is being done in renewable the day is bound to come when it will be affordable may be after two or three decades, he said.

His remarks came against the backdrop of aviation watchdog DGCA grounding 14 A320 neo planes, operated by IndiGo NSE 0.78 % and GoAir, due to problems with their Pratt & Whitney engines.

""Pratt & Whitney has done some retrofitting, which has resulted in some challenges in engines. So, when I became the (civil aviation) minister, it was pointed out to me... I said this is too risky because safety should not be compromised on any account,"" Prabhu told PTI in an interview.

Prabhu, who took charge of Civil Aviation Ministry on March 12, noted that safety should not be compromised on any account.

On the same day, aviation regulator DGCA ordered IndiGo and GoAir to immediately ground 11 A320 neo planes powered with a certain series of P&W engines after incidents of mid-air engine failures.

""Let them rectify this error and till that time they will be grounded and we called the airlines and told them to make alternate arrangements,"" Prabhu said.

""By doing this, we are ensuring that there will be zero tolerance on safety issues,"" he said, adding that the engines will be required to be certified again for air worthiness.

While 14 planes were grounded by IndiGo and GoAir last month due to engine issues, some of them are back in operation after being fitted with spare engines from P&W.

Following the grounding of aircraft, there has been a significant number of flight cancellations by the two carriers.

According to the minister, the situation is more or less stabilised in terms of disruptions.

About regional air connectivity scheme UDAN, Prabhu said funds are not an issue. The funds are coming by way of cross-subsidisation, ""so there is no problem,"" he added.

UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) seeks to connect unserved and under-served airports as well as make flying more affordable for the common people.

Towards providing viability gap funding for carriers participating in the scheme, the government is collecting levy from airlines flying on major routes. Various other incentives are also extended to the carriers under UDAN."

As data theft becomes the political buzzword pitching the ruling BJP against the opposition Congress, recent revelations on the issue have forced people to re-examine their everyday social media browsing habits, particularly on Facebook.

It started mid March with international media reports claiming that the profiles of 50 million Facebook users were harvested by UK-based analytics firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) to influence the US presidential election and the pro-Brexit campaign as well as polls in other countries.

The resulting storm engulfed India too, with former CA employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie claiming the firm extensively operated in the country and had served political parties, including the Congress and the Janata Dal (United).

Beyond the global impact of the biggest-ever data breaches and the social media behemoth Facebook, the scandal brought to the fore the shortcoming of India's laws to deal with ever advancing issues of online privacy and data theft in the country, say experts.

""India has the second highest number of internet users globally. However India's Information Technology Act, 2000 and its amendments -- 2008 and 2011 -- are not well suited to deal with social media and internet related cyber-crimes,"" said Jaspreet Singh, partner, Cyber Security, Ernst & Young.

According to figures by Internet World Stats, a website featuring data on global internet usage, China had highest number of internet users at 738.5 million till December 31, 2017. India was second and the US third with 286.94 million users.

India does not have a dedicated law on data protection and privacy, said Singh.

""Consequently, the third party transfers and cross border movement of personal data, the entire sharing ecosystem, is not adequately dealt with under the Indian IT Act. If any organisation is disclosing the personal information to third parties in India for data profiling or other such marketing and business purposes, there is no effective legal solution that is available,"" he added.

Supreme Court lawyer Pavan Duggal said it would be a mistake to expect the IT Act to be a holistic one-point legal framework for cyber security as it was enacted 10 years ago.

""... there have been dramatic advances in cyber security and also cyber security breaches, but the law has stood frozen in point of time in history,"" the cyber law specialist told .

Going by Indian law, the data breach episode, which has attracted a probe by regulators and governments in several countries and also triggered panic amongst millions of internet users, is at best ""immoral or unethical"" but not illegal.

""If you take Cambridge Analytica as an example, what they have done is mining of data and purchase of data with the consent of users by tricking them into giving their consent and taking off their data.

""So you may call this entire practice of data collection and data harvesting immoral and unethical, but according to Indian laws it is not illegal. It is not against the law of the land,"" said cyber security expert Jiten Jain.

The Facebook-CA episode throws up a host of issues, added Rama Vedashree, CEO of the Data Security Council of India (DSCI), stressing the need for clarity about the roles, obligations and responsibilities of all stakeholders towards protecting data and protecting individual privacy in the ecosystem.

""I won't call it the way it is being positioned -- as a security breach or a data breach -- but possibly a breach of trust of the users who have shared their data because the data was used or harvested for some other purpose which the user was not not even aware of. I think that is the fundamental thing (here),"" she said.

Biju Janata Dal MP Baijayant 'Jay' Panda has filed a private members bill in Parliament and been passionately championing the cause for ""sensible new regulations"".

""Using data for marketing and political campaigning purposes should be done legitimately, with the consent of people whose data is being used and also in line with a modern regulatory framework that protects privacy and enshrines accountability for misuse of data,"" he said.

Panda described the current Indian regulatory framework as inadequate, especially since these challenges are rapidly evolving in a widely connected world.

As debates over online privacy trended globally following the data breach expose, there were acrimonious exchanges in India between its two main parties.

While the BJP attacked the Congress and asked it to explain CA's role in its social media outreach, the opposition party said it was the BJP which hired the services of the controversial firm during Bihar and other state polls as well as for its 'Mission 272-plus' campaign

Congress president Rahul Gandhi recently claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official mobile application works as a ""spying"" tool and dubbed him as the ""Big Boss who likes to spy on Indians"".

A total of 148 companies got listed with initial public offers (IPOs) worth Rs 2,155 crore in the last fiscal compared to 80 firms which tapped the IPO route to garner Rs 810 crore in 2016-17.

In 2015-16, as many as 46 firms made debut on SME platforms and raised Rs 303 crore.

These companies are listed on SME platforms of BSE and NSE.

""Growing SME Capital Markets have addressed several myths and lent a lot of confidence to growing entrepreneurs. With companies listed on SME platform becoming more established, investor base is also getting broadened. Moreover with increasing number of SME stocks and greater returns thereon, more and more investors are getting attracted for SME investing.

""The just concluded fiscal witnessed phenomenal figures in terms of funds raised and the number of listings, we expect to witness the trend to continue in the near future,"" Pantomath Group Managing Director Mahavir Lunawat said.

Geographically, Gujarat topped the list as a maximum 50 firms from the state listed on SME bourses, followed by Maharashtra (43), Madhya Pradesh (13), Delhi (10), and Telangana and West Bengal (5 each).

Further, average issue size also increased during the past fiscal to Rs 14.56 crore against Rs 10.12 crore each for the preceding financial year.

Besides, institutional investors including banks and mutual funds have showed interest in the SME's public offers.

Notably, the just concluded fiscal also witnessed tremendous response from investors in terms of subscriptions with 9 IPOs getting subscribed more than 100 times the issue size, reflecting growing interest and faith of investors in SME capital markets.

Out of 148 companies listed in 2017-18, 64 companies made a high of upper circuit limit at 20 per cent on the first day of listing.

The companies which got listed in the past fiscal are from sectors such as manufacturing, textiles, engineering, agriculture, chemicals, food processing, media and entertainment, construction and finance and investments based out of more than 60 cities covering remotest areas of India.

BSE and NSE had launched SME platforms in March 2012, becoming the only two bourses to offer such a segment in the country. Since then, 370 companies have got listed on them raising close to Rs 4,100 crore with a market capitalisation of Rs 33,000 crore.

Some of these SMEs have even shifted to the main-board.

The platform provides opportunity to SME entrepreneurs to raise equity capital for growth and expansion. It also provides immense opportunity for investors to identify and invest in good SMEs at an early stage."

The reference to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) follows a revival of a plan to split GAIL by hiving off gas marketing business into a separate firm, leaving just pipeline transportation with GAIL.

""GAIL was created in 1984 by hiving off gas business out of ONGC. ONGC NSE -1.43 % was producing oil and gas, and also transporting it. GAIL was hived out of ONGC for transportation of natural gas, and then slowly it also acquired the activities relating to marketing of gas,"" an official privy to the development said.

He said it is a well-accepted fact that there is some conflict of interest between the same entity that carries out transportation of natural gas and also markets it.

Over a period of time more players have come into gas marketing. Gujarat government entity GSPC is a major player in gas marketing and also in gas transportation.

""So, we have asked the PNGRB to look into this issue of how to resolve this conflict and come up with some suggestion,"" he said.

The Government had in 2006 issued the Policy for Development of Natural Gas Pipelines and City for Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks which envisaged that in the long run and with the maturing of gas markets, the authorised entities will have transportation of natural gas as their sole business activity and will not have any business interest in the gas marketing or city or local gas distribution networks.

""So, as we move towards a more gas-based economy, there is a conflict of interest between the activities of transportation of gas and marketing of gas,"" the official said.

GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.

In the past GAIL resisted the split on grounds that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arms length, and hence do not need to be separated.

GAIL's marketing business formed 71 per cent of its 2016 -17 total sales, and 25 per cent pre-tax profit.

The government has 54.89 per cent stake in GAIL India."

165,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 03:47 PM IST",PTI,Cons. Products,Textile exports likely to miss $45bn target for FY18,"NEW DELHI: Textile and garment exports are likely to miss the USD 45 billion target for 2017-18, as the industry reels under the impact of GST roll out and tariff advantages enjoyed by competitors like Bangladesh and Vietnam, according to textile industry body CITI.

""At best, we will come close to USD 40 billion,"" CITI (Confederation of Indian Textile Industry) President Sanjay Jain told , terming it a ""disappointing year"".

In fact, shipments from the textile and clothing sector have consistently missed annual targets set by the government in at least the previous three financial years, since 2014-15.

Analysis of data put out by the DGCIS (Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics) under the commerce ministry, reveals the true picture of shipments from the sector.

During the April-February 2017-18, exports of readymade garments of all textiles stood at Rs 97,983.99 crore, registering a 6.25 per cent decline over the same period last year. In February alone, shipments witnessed a steep 13.86 per cent fall.

In dollar terms, the country's textile and apparel exports stood at USD 37.25 billion in the calendar year 2017.

According to Jain, the domestic textiles and apparel industry faces a big threat from rising imports due to the removal of countervailing duty and special additional duty in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.

""Although these duties have been replaced by IGST, the fact that an importer can adjust them as per his tax liability has led to a 15-16 per cent downfall in the import protection enjoyed by the domestic industry earlier,"" the CITI chief points out.

He noted that the steep up-trend in imports will only worsen the situation going forward, observing that a worrying factor is the backdoor entry of Chinese fabrics into the Indian market via Bangladesh.

Textile industry experts feel another negative factor is that the effective duty drawback, whether it is the remission of state levies (RoSL) or the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) which allows duty credit scrips as rewards, has come down for the sector post implementation of GST, thereby hitting export margins.

""Although the RoSL and MEIS rates were tweaked late last year, however, a 2 per cent gap still exists, which is crucial in a single digit margin industry,"" Jain noted.

Moreover, he says, the refunds are getting delayed or blocked whereas the rebate under RoSL has only come through till May-June last year, and the financial crunch is taking a toll on the capital intensive industry.

Signing free trade pacts with major markets like the European Union, US, Canada and Britain can equalise market access positions with key competitors like Bangladesh and Vietnam. Bangladesh has zero duty access to EU, whereas Vietnam is on its way to acquire duty free access under a trade agreement, jain noted.

The sector expects the government to at least partially compensate the industry in the interim period.

China, which is the largest market for cotton yarn, has imposed around 3.5 per cent import duty on yarn from India under Asia pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), while duty free access is given to Vietnam.

This has led to large capacity expansion in yarn manufacturing in Vietnam, which has surpassed India to become the largest supplier of cotton yarn to China.

As a result, India's cotton yarn exports to China have decreased by 49 per cent during 2013-14 and 2016-17, while Vietnam's exports of cotton yarn to China have increased by 88 per cent during the same period.

The CITI chief also highlighted the need to have a comprehensive national and state coordination committee to streamline the policies of the Centre and states, and bridge any gaps in communication."

Based on fictional dinosaurs and squids, the material developed by engineers at the University of California, Irvine, could protect soldiers and structures, according to new findings published in the journal Science.

The thin swatches can quickly change how they reflect heat, smoothing or wrinkling their surfaces in under a second after being stretched or electrically triggered.

That makes them invisible to infrared night vision tools or lets them modulate their temperatures.

""Basically, we have invented a soft material that can reflect heat in similar ways to how squid skin can reflect light. It goes from wrinkled and dull to smooth and shiny, essentially changing the way it reflects the heat,"" said corresponding author Alon Gorodetsky.

Made of sandwiched aluminium, plastic and sticky tape, the material transforms from a wrinkled grey to a glossy surface when it is either pulled manually or zapped with voltage.

""It was hard, especially the first phase when we were learning how to work with the sticky material,"" added lead author Chengyi Xu.

Potential uses of the material include better camouflage for troops and insulation for spacecraft, storage containers, emergency shelters, clinical care and building heating and cooling systems.

Challenging the order of the CIC, which had asked the government to give the reasons why it had agreed to the hike, the defence ministry through a writ petition claimed the Inter Governmental Agreement between India and Russia bars the disclosure of such details and would come under the RTI Act's exemption clause of Section 8(1)(a).

""...the IGA in clause 9 specifically states the sides ...not to disclose the contents of the present agreement as well as all the correspondence and information related to its implementation without mutual consent...,"" it said.

The ministry said any further information related to payments made by India or acceptance of upward revision in cost and time was not only bound by the clauses of the IGA but would also constitute a breach of parliamentary privileges and be prejudicial to the interest of the country.

The deal for purchasing the ship, rechristened INS Vikramaditya, was signed in 2004 by the then NDA government at USD 974 million. The cost was raised to the final price of USD 2.35 billion in 2010.

Information Commissioner Amitava Bhattacharya had conducted detailed hearings and heard all arguments before ordering the disclosure of information last year on a plea of activist Subhash Agrawal about cost escalation and others issues.

The court has now asked Agrawal to appear before it on the matter on April 5.

The CIC had also directed the defence ministry to disclose reasons why the country chose a refurbished warship in place of purchasing a new one and the net final cost including the expenditure on the modifications, renovations and remodelling done on the now 30-year-old ship and dates of payments made by India.

The ministry said if the details were disclosed, ""cardinal relation of India and Russia"" will be affected due to the violation of the agreement which will be detrimental to the relationship with a foreign state and be ""prejudicial to the interest of the state"".

""The Information Commissioner failed to consider that no information bound by the IGA can be disclosed without the prior approval of the government of Russia,"" the ministry said.

It said bringing to the public domain the details of the fittings, fixtures and ammunition that were used for repair, re-equipping, renovation of the warship and thereby disclosing the capability of the ship would be ""prejudicial to national security and expose war preparedness of the country"".

It said certain aspects of action taken on a CAG report on the subject were deemed to be classified and their disclosure would constitute a breach of national security.

Information Commissioner Bhattacharya had noted that the Navy was trying to put the onus of the disclosure on the defence ministry whereas the ministry made it clear that the reply was to be furnished by the force.

He had directed the Navy to disclose file notings, correspondence and documents related to the acceptance of cost-revisions demanded by the Russians.

The commission asked for the disclosure noting that there was a ""larger public interest"" in the information which was withheld by the ministry and the Navy on grounds of national security.

Bhattacharya also directed the ministry to disclose the reasons why India chose to opt for a refurbished warship in place of a new one.

The case relates to an RTI application filed by activist Agrawal who had demanded a range of information on the acquisition of the 44,500-tonne aircraft carrier.

The ship was originally commissioned by the erstwhile USSR on December 20, 1987, and was decommissioned in 1996.

After being inducted into the Navy as Vikramaditya, the ship is now a floating 284- metre long airfield. It is a 20-storeyed steel mega-structure floating in the sea from keel to the highest point.

The ship can carry over 30 aircraft including state-of-the-art MiG 29K or Sea Harriers, Kamov 31, Kamov 28, Sea King, ALH--Dhruv and Chetak helicopters.

With 22 decks and a capacity of 1,600 personal, the ship can sustain itself on sea for 45 days up to a range of over 13,000 km."

177,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 04:54 PM IST",PTI,Defence,Jawan's video: BSF orders food test by DRDO lab,"NEW DELHI: Faced with questions over the quality of food, the BSF has commissioned an assessment by the DRDO to analyse the quality and quantity of meals being served to jawans and officers of the paramilitary force.

The Border Security Force (BSF) also suggested measures to improve possible shortcomings.

The move comes over a year after a BSF jawan had posted a video on a social media site claiming watery soup-like dal and burnt chappatis were being served to personnel.

BSF Director General (DG) K K Sharma told in an interview that the first-of-its-kind step was taken on the recommendation of a parliamentary panel that took up the issue recently.

""We are getting a study done from a DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) laboratory to analyse the quality of the food being served in BSF messes. These experts are also talking to the personnel who prepare the food, run the unit mess and also those who consume it.

""While a final report is awaited, what we have been made to understand is that both the quality and quantity of our food for jawans and officers has been found to be more than satisfactory as part of the study,"" the paramilitary chief said.

The DRDO's Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) based in Mysore in Karnataka is conducting the assessment.

The DFRL is a special laboratory to conduct research and development related to dietary and nutritional requirements of security personnel.

A parliamentary panel, in its report, had noted that there was an ""adverse report on social media"" about the quality of food being served to BSF personnel.

""The committee (members) are of the view that providing good quality food to CAPFs (Central Armed Police Forces) personnel is not only necessary to keep them healthy and fit but also for boosting their morale.

""The committee, therefore, recommended that a mechanism be put in place for testing food items being supplied to CAPFs at the source of supply itself, whereby it is tested and certified in respect of nutritional values, hygiene and labelled as fit for consumption,"" the report had stated.

Sharma said that an internal inquiry conducted by the BSF after its jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav posted a video on social media claiming bad food was being served, had found that the quality and quantity of food being served was never an issue among the forces' personnel.

Yadav had in January last year posted a video on Facebook that showed a meal box comprising a watery soup-like dal, which he claimed had only turmeric and salt, and a burnt chapatti.

The DG said three immediate supervisory officers of Yadav's unit -- a Deputy Inspector General (DIG), a Commandant and a Company Commander (Assistant Commandant)-- of Yadav's unit were shifted after the incident as punishment and on grounds of ""failure of command.""

The officers did not know that a constable is facing problems and complaining about something, which may or may not be wrong, he said.

""They got to know when the jawan uploaded something (on social media). So, it is the failure of the supervisory officers in having a proper connect with the subordinates. One must know what is happening.

""This was identified as a weakness of the officers and failure of command and they were shifted. This action was not undertaken because the food was bad,"" Sharma said.

He said the area along the Line of Control where Yadav was posted is under the operational command of the Army and the food is supplied by them at these locations.

""It is largely tinned food at these high-altitude and difficult locations. The entire ration process has been decentralised by us at the International Border (IB) where we have our independent command,"" he said.

The DG added that Yadav, last year in April, was sacked and charge sheeted for indiscipline and uploading a video in violation of rules.

Such conduct ""cannot be tolerated"" in a security force and this action was not taken against him for complaining about the quality of food, he said.

Sharma reiterated that the BSF, as an organisation, has taken a policy decision that the use of smart phones and social media will not be disallowed despite this incident.

""I feel why should I punish 2.5 lakh people just because the mistake of one man. If they want to enhance their knowledge and keep in touch with their family by using the Internet, then why should I stop them?"" the DG said.

""We have just told our personnel that social media and Internet has to be used sensibly and anything that they receive on social media should not be believed without verifying its authenticity,"" Sharma said.

The BSF is tasked to guard the two important and sensitive Indian borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh and it also renders a variety of internal security duties across the country including undertaking anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh and Odisha."

The session on Wednesday, which was the last trading day of the previous week as well as the expiry day of March series F&O contracts, saw the market end on a weaker note, with the Nifty50 losing 70.45 points, or 0.69 per cent.

Global markets were shut on Friday on account of Good Friday. On Thursday, they ended on a much stronger note. In all likelihood, Indian market is likely to see a strong opening and the Nifty50 may open above the 200-DMA at 10,180.

As has been the case always, it would be critical to see if the market is able to capitalise on the likely stronger opening that it is set to get on Monday.

Nifty’s sustenance and closing above the 200-DMA will be a key technical point to watch out for. The 10,180 and 10,225 levels will act as immediate resistance levels for the 50-pack. Support should come in at 10,075 and 10,040 levels.

The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart stood at 40.7668 and it remained neutral showing no divergence from price. The daily MACD is bearish, as it traded below the signal line. However, it is moving towards reporting a positive crossover. No significant formations were seen on the candles.


Pattern analysis showed the 10,180 level, which is the 200-DMA for the Nifty50, also happens to be one of the important pattern resistance levels as is evident from the chart. This level, once breached on the upside, is likely to act as support going ahead.

Overall, there are high probabilities of the Nifty50 enjoying a strong opening on Monday. However, moving past and sustaining above the 200-DMA will be crucial. If the Nifty50 moves past and sustains above the 10,180 mark, it would be a significant technical development and the Nifty50, in that case, will mark a temporary bottom for itself for the immediate short term.

""Microsoft Ventures is not here yet. We intend to come to this market...there will be an explicit commitment for India,"" its executive vice-president for business development Peggy Johnson told recently.

Johnson, who reports to the company's India-born chief executive Satya Nadella, however, did not quantify the overall commitment that will be made to India, saying an announcement on the same will be made shortly.

Microsoft Ventures invests at an early-stage in start-ups and currently has offices in London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Tel Aviv.

The company already services about 5,000 Indian startups through its various programmes, including seven accelerators, with partners like an arm of Reliance Industries and 24 third-party accelerators, she said.

Johnson said engagement with the startup world is very important for her company.

Reacting to recent media reports, she said there has been a change in the leadership of the accelerator programme but affirmed that the commitment to the startup community remains unchanged.

The company looks at India both as a hub for its research and development, and engineering activities, and also as a market for its products, and has 11 offices in the country now employing 8,000.

Johnson said the firm feels its three data centers in the country are ""sufficient"" and expressed satisfaction at its presence in the market, which is witnessing heavy competition.

Amid the growing instances of frauds at banks, like the over Rs 13,000-crore Nirav Modi scam at PNB, Johnson said technology can help prevent such frauds.

""Because they have vast amounts of data, we can help. We have seen interest from banking sector the world over and I think it can help them be more efficient with some of their processes and take out some of the manual parts that can introduce error into the process,"" she said.

The company already works with Bandhan Bank and Bajaj Finserv, another company official said.

On the ongoing difficulties faced by the tech sector following the Cambridge Analytica revelations that have put social media giant Facebook in a spot, Johnson said Microsoft has a history of compliance and will adopt any new regulations as well.

She also said technology tools like blockchain can help resolve the current concerns on the data security and privacy front."

The arrest came barely a few hours after a Bhagalpur court rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Shashwat against whom an arrest warrant was issued on March 24.

""We had information that Shashwat was at the famous Hanuman temple in the vicinity of Patna junction. A police team reached the spot and arrested him and he has been sent to Bhagalpur"", Senior Superintendent of Police, Patna, Manu Maharaj told PTI.

The police produced Shashwat at the residence of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate A R Upadhyay, who sent him to 14 days judicial custody, public prosecutor Satya Narayan Prasad Sah said.

Shashwat is the son of Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey.

On his arrest, Shashwat told reporters ""I have given myself up to police in deference to the court order. I have been wrongly accused of evading arrest.

""I was not absconding as I have not committed any crime. If raising slogans in praise of 'Bharat Mata' and 'Sri Ram' is a crime then I may be called a criminal."" Shashwat has been named, besides eight others, in one of the two FIRs lodged at Nathnagar police station of Bhagalpur following communal riots that broke out on March 17 after some people objected to playing of loud music during a procession led by him.

It had been taken out allegedly without permission to celebrate the New Year as per the Hindu calendar.

Several persons, including two police personnel, were injured in the clashes that witnessed heavy stone-pelting, arson and exchange of fire.

The alleged delay in Shashwat's arrest had invited strong criticism from opposition parties in Bihar, especially the RJD-Congress combine, which accused the Nitish Kumar government of soft-peddling the matter while Choubey had dubbed the FIR against his son as a ""piece of garbage"".

Reacting to Shashwat's arrest, ruling JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said it was a fitting reply to the Opposition while Congress leader Prem Chand Mishra said the whole episode showed the ""helplessness"" of Kumar before the BJP."

Auto makers such as Maruti NSE 0.86 % Suzuki and Tata Motors NSE -1.98 % reported steady growth with new models Swift and Nexon pushing up sales numbers last month. Commercial vehicles and tractors also made a strong showing, with the budget having pledged greater spends in infrastructure and increased support for farmers.

The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki reported a growth of 15.3% to sell 147,170 units last month. While sales of mini cars (Alto, WagonR) rose 21.1% to 37,511 units, those of compacts (Swift, Baleno, Ignis, Celerio, DZire, Tour S) surged 13.5% to 68,885 units. Demand for midsize sedan Ciaz dropped by 12.1% to 4,321 units. However, utility vehicles (Ertiga, S-Cross, Vitara Brezza) sustained their growth momentum - sales rose 24.3% to 22,764 units.

The company ended the year on a high, growing domestic sales by 13.8% to 1,643, 467 units.


Meanwhile, homegrown auto major Tata Motors reported a 31% increase in passenger vehicle sales at 20266 units for March. Though passenger car sales for the company declined by 4%, demand in the utility vehicle segment more than trebled in the period under review. For the entire fiscal year (2017-18), the company’s passenger vehicle sales grew by 22% to close at 187,321 units.

Mayank Pareek, president, passenger vehicle business units at Tata Motors said, “We have ended FY18 with robust sales performance with a growth of 31% on the back of our new generation cars. With Nexon, we are making good progress in the UV segment. We look forward to sustaining this growth rate and continue this momentum in FY19.”

As the country’s largest commercial vehicle manufaturer, Tata Motors continued to gain momentum growing by 37% to 49174 units. “The government’s push towards infrastructure development, restriction on overloading of trucks, road construction and mining activities has boosted demand in the MHCV segment...”, said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicle business unit, Tata Motors. Demand for movement of aggregate, sand and coal pushed up tipper sales by 58%. Volumes in the intermediate and light commercial vehicle segments too nearly doubled last month driven by new product launches, e-commerce and logistics sectors.

Cumulative sales of commercial vehicles (April 2017 – March 2018) for Tata Motors in domestic market stood at 399,318 units, which is a increase of 23% over 325,211 units sold the previous fiscal.

At VE Commercial Vehicles, commercial vehicle sales in the domestic market went up by 22.5 % to 8146 units in March. The company sold a total of 56920 units of Eicher and Volvo branded trucks and buses last fiscal.

The upswing in demand was reflected in sale of tractors as well. Last month, Sonalika Tractors increased sales by a whopping 80% to sell a total of 12,791 tractors. In the entire fiscal year, the company grew volumes by 22% to sell 100,001 tractors.

Sonalika said favorable monsoons, combined with the government’s pro-agriculture allocation should enable the industry to grow at a steady pace in 2018.

DABHOL: Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said the government is open to Saudi oil giant Aramco's interest to own majority stake in the proposed Rs 3-trillion refinery at Ratnagiri, which when completed will be the largest single location refinery complex in the world with a capacity of 60 million tonne.

Saudi Aramco has reportedly sought majority ownership in the mega refinery-cum-petrochemical complex for which state-owned oil firms Indian Oil NSE -1.40 %, Bharat Petroleum NSE 0.22 % and Hindustan Petroleum have inked an agreement.

""Aramco is in discussions with us. We have held many rounds of talks on the Ratnagiri project with them. It's a commercial project and we are open to their suggestion (of giving majority stake),"" Pradhan told here over the weekend.

The minister was responding to a question on whether the world's largest oil company that is working on a USD 1-trillion initial public float this year, has really sought majority stake in the project.

Some media reports had last month said the Saudis were interested in the USD 40-billion project provided India was ready to offer majority control and that the facility will mostly use Saudi crude.

When specifically asked whether the government was ready to offer majority stake in the project, Pradhan said ""yes"", though did not quantify their demand.

""Yes it's a commercial project and the ownership is still open,"" said the minister.

IOC currently owns a 50 per cent stake in the project, with the remainder is equally split between BPCL and HPCL NSE -1.59 %.

When asked about the status of the Ratnagiri refinery, especially land procurement in the face of stiff opposition from the public as well as the ruling BJP ally Shiv Sena, Pradhan said, ""I am optimistic that everything can be resolved through discussions. Every issue can be discussed and resolved with talks. Let's see.""

Once all the clearances are in, it will at least five to six years for the refinery to commence production. The refinery will include three crude units of 20 million tonnes each and will produce petrol, diesel, LPG, aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and feedstock for making petrochemicals such as plastics, chemicals and textiles.

While the project will give IOC a strong foothold in the western states as catering to customers in the west and the south is difficult with its refineries located mostly in the north, for HPCL and BPCL this will increase their capacity as their Mumbai refineries cannot be expanded further.

Currently the country has a refining capacity of a little over 232 million tonne, against the domestic demand of 194.2 million tonne in fiscal 2017. According to the International Energy Agency, this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonne by 2040. The country is the world's third-biggest oil importer.

IOC has 11 refineries with a capacity of 81.2 million tonne, while BPCL runs four with a capacity of 33.4 million tonne and HPCL operates three refineries with a capacity of 24.8 million tonne.

Saudi's interest in the project can be seen as securing its future with a large customer as increasing India has been moving away from Saudi to other markets like Africa, Latin America and even the US.

Also, in the first week of March, Iraq overtook Saudi by a wide margin to become India's top crude supplier, meeting over a fifth of the oil needs.

Saudi, has traditionally been the top oil source for India, but in the April-January period of 2017-18, Iraq shipped 38.9 million tonne, which is more than 20 per cent of the annul imports."

Top brass of the BJP, which considers the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as its ideological mentor, has often talked about a 'Congress-free India'.

""These are political slogans. It is not the language of the RSS. The word 'mukt' (free or liberated) is used in politics. We never use the language of excluding anyone.

""We have to include everyone in the process of nation-building including those who oppose us,"" Bhagwat said at a book launch function here.

Speaking in parliament in February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said he was pursuing Mahatma Gandhi's dream of a 'Congress-mukt Bharat' and accused the grand old party of eulogising the Gandhi family when in power, at the cost of the country's development.

Bhagwat was in the city to launch six books written by Dnyaneshwar Mulay, a 1983-batch Indian Foreign Service officer, who is currently secretary (Consular, Passport, Visa and Overseas Indian Affairs) in the Ministry of External Affairs.

192,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 06:27 PM IST",PTI,Defence,Doklam lesson: Army increases strength at India-China-Myanmar tri-junction near Tibet,"WALONG (ARUNACHAL PRADESH): Indian troops deployed along the disputed Sino-India border in the Himalayan range of the Arunachal sector have increased their patrolling at a tri-junction of India, China and Myanmar to prevent a repeat of a Doklam-like standoff.

Top Army officials told PTI that the tri-junction, located around 50km from Walong, the easternmost town of India near the Tibet region, is extremely important for India to help it maintain its dominance in the nearby mountain passes and other areas.

""After the Doklam standoff, we have increased our presence on India's side of the tri-junction as it is very important for us from the strategic dimension,"" a senior Army official said.

He said Chinese troops did not enter the Tri-junction too frequently but had developed a road infrastructure near the area which could be advantageous for the mobilisation of army personnel.

Walong, situated on the bank of Lohit river, had witnessed the bravery of Indian troops against Chinese aggression during the 1962 war between the two countries.

The deepening of military engagement between China and Myanmar was another reason for India ramping up its presence at the tri-junction with thick rainforests on the Himalayan ranges.

The official said Myanmarese border guarding forces did not patrol the tri-junction.

""After the tri-junction in Doklam in the Sikkim sector, this is the most important tri-junction along the Sino-India border,"" he said.

Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Doklam from June 16 last year after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. The face-off ended on August 28.

The area in Doklam where China tried to construct a road is a disputed territory claimed by both China and Bhutan. India sent its troops to stop the Chinese construction activity, saying it could be a threat to its strategic interests in the region.

Since the Doklam standoff, India has deployed more troops and increased patrolling along the borders with China in the Tibetan region.

Another official said Indian troops have also enhanced their presence in all the areas in the Lohit Valley near the tri-junction.

""There are 18 mountain passes in the region and we have been carrying out long-range patrols to all these passes regularly,"" he said.

He further said,"" We have been carrying out war rehearsals regularly. You have to be in an offensive mode to remain in an advantageous position.""

China has been laying new roads and improving its overall infrastructure along the nearly 4,000km-long border with India.

Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last month that China had undertaken the construction of helipads, sentry posts and trenches for its army personnel near Doklam.

Sources said China has been keeping its troops in north Doklam and significantly ramping up its infrastructure in the disputed area.

In January, Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat had said the time had come for India to shift its focus from its borders with Pakistan to the frontier with China, indicating the seriousness of the situation."

Konkan LNG, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Gail, had on March 30 received the first 1.2 lakh tonne shipment of the 5.8-mt LNG contracted from the first-ever long-term agreement with the US signed way back in 2011 and 2013.

""We will be investing around Rs 3,000 crore in Dabhol terminal to increase its capacity to 10 million tonne from the present 5 mt, which is also underutilised now due to the terminal not being an all-weather facility.

""So, to make the Dabhol terminal an all-season facility, first we will invest around Rs 700 crore to complete the abandoned and semi-finished breakwater. Rest of the investment will go into capacity expansion,"" Gail chairman and managing director BC Tripathi said.

Gail created Konkan LNG recently after demerging it from Ratnagiri Gas & Power, which is a three-way joint venture it has with NTPC and Maharashtra SEB. The JV was created to run Dabhol Power which was abandoned by Enron Corporation early 2000 following its global bankruptcy.

The entire project will take around three years to complete, and will be executed by Konkan LNG, Tripathi said, adding that work on the breakwater should be begin shortly. Currently the terminal can operate only about eight months in a year due to not having a breakwater.

""We've finalised the tender for the breakwater which will be floated very soon and hope to begin work before the monsoons at the earliest or soon after the monsoons,"" petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan said here on Friday receiving the first shipment of 1.2 lakh tonne LNG from the US.

Gail commissioned the Dabhol terminal in 2013 and the US vessel was the 78th berthing, Tripathi said.

The company will get 22-24 shipments per annum till the breakwater is built. Once that is done the annual intake will be 80-90 ships.

It had in 2011 and 2013 entered into two contracts of 20 years each, to lift 5.8 mt of LNG from the US, which is valued at around USD 32 billion. The gas will come the Dominion Cove Point project in Maryland (signed in 2011) and the Sabine Pass project in Louisiana (agreement signed 2013) from the US.

The under-construction breakwater at the Dabhol terminal, was created in FY07 by the original Dabhol power plant promoter Enron Corporation which went bankrupt following which it abandoned the 1,200-mw power plant.

The minister had claimed that the country could negotiate ""a very competitive price from the US which offers one of the best prices of LNG,"" without disclosing the average price of the maiden shipment.

""Pricing is a commercial matter that cannot be publicly discussed. All I can assure you is that we have managed one of the best prices which should help the end-consumers,"" he told PTI, adding industrial and residential customers in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

But it can be noted that when the first shipment was loaded, the crude was trading over USD 81 a barrel, and on the day it arrived it was ruling under USD 70 a barrel. Crude and LNG prices are linked.

Pradhan also said the beginning of the oil and gas shipments from the US will boost Indo-US trade and has the potential to raise it by USD 2-3 billion annually, considering massive spike in energy demand, making the country third largest in the world.

Indo-US trade has been rising 11.4 per cent on average annually since 2000 when it had stood at a USD 20 billion and crossed USD 126 billion in 2017.

It can be noted that Asia is the largest consumer of LNG in the world with around 70 per cent of consumption led by Japan, China and India.

""Once this pipeline delivery begins, this will connect the state-run gas major's Kochi-Kuttanad- Mangalore-Bengaluru pipeline,"" Gail said.

Describing the arrival of the first shipment and the conclusion of the long-term contract with the US-based Cheniere Inc as ""a new beginning in the Indo-US energy partnership and trade,"" Pradhan said LNG supplies is linked to the Henry Hub index contract and also ""will help achieve the vision of moving towards a gas-based economy"".

This is after the company registered a continuous negative growth for five years from 2009-10 to 2013-14, the company said in a release.

Growth in production in consecutive years was possible because of opening of 19 projects during last three years which added to more than 27 mt during 2017-18, it said.

In order to have enhancement in production for future sustainability, WCL has taken steps to enhance the existing mine capacity, which will be adding about 6.5 mt during 2018-19, it added.

Meanwhile, WCL achieved a new record in despatch of coal as well during 2017-18 by despatching 48.76 mt against the highest ever of 45.509 mt achieved during 2009-10, according to the release.

It also created a record by achieving a growth of 23.5 per cent in coal off-take during 2017-18, which is the highest among all the subsidiaries of CIL.

During the year, the company despatched 9,204 rakes of coal, which is 28.84 per cent higher over last year.

With a coal stock of 11.60 mt in the mines as on April 1, WCL said it could successfully despatch coal to its consumers as per their demand.

WCL surpassed its capital expenditure (capex) target of Rs 1,050 crore during 2017-18, which according to the company will help it in its future growth.

It has also achieved a record 185.29 million cubic meter of overburden removal during 2017-18, registering a growth of about 12 per cent over last year.

The company expects to cross the 50 mt level of coal production in 2018-19, to achieve a target of 52.5 mt, according to the release.

It will also gear up to achieve the coal despatch target of 58.7 mt during 2018-19, the release added.

WCL has been successful in getting four coal blocks in Odisha during 2017-18. The company said it plans to have two large opencast mines of 25 mt each to achieve 50 mt production from these four blocks.

""All out efforts are being made to develop these blocks as quickly as possible. This new property will not only help WCL in adding to its coal volume, but will also be beneficial for its financial stability,"" the company said.

With this acquisition, WCL becomes the first company in CIL to have its operations in three states - Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.

In the area of corporate social responsibility, the company set up a reverse osmosis (RO) plant at Patansaongi near Nagpur last year and launched bottled water under the brand 'Coal Neer' for rural population.

The plan is to add six more such plants during 2018-19 so as to cover the entire rural populace by providing treated water at a much lower cost, the release said.

WCL also aims to commercially launch 'Coal Neer' during 2018-19.

197,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 06:48 PM IST",ET Bureau,Science,"ISRO loses contact with GSAT-6A, trying to establish link","BENGALURU: Two days after India's latest communication satellite with military applications GSAT-6A was launched, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) today said it had lost contact with it and was making efforts to establish link.

The space agency lost communication with the satellite when it attempted to ignite the engine in a third and final move to its desired location after its March 29 textbook launch from the space port of Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.

The second orbit raising operation of GSAT-6A was successfully carried out on Saturday, but when it was on course to normal operating configuration for the third and final firing scheduled for April 1, communication with the satellite was lost, the space agency said after maintaining unusual silence on the health of the satellite.

A satellite is placed in orbit in three phases.

""Efforts are underway to establish link with the satellite,"" Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO said on its website.

The 2,140-kg GSAT-6A rode piggyback on ISRO's powerful geosynchronous rocket (GSLV-F08) fitted with indigenous cryogenic engine at the third stage and was put into orbit successfully after the launch in what was described by a senior ISRO official as a ""magnificent mission"".

GSAT-6A is aimed at helping in mobile communication even from very remote locations through hand-held ground terminals and is considered a shot in the arm for the armed forces.

The space agency's unusual silence regarding the satellite had set off speculation about its health.

ISRO, which normally communicates on its website about the orbit raising operations like it did on March 30, following the success of the first orbit raising operation, had not released any update since then.

The last update was on March 30, wherein it said, ""The first orbit raising operation of GSAT-6A Satellite has been successfully carried out by Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) Engine firing for 2188 sec from 09:22hr IST on March 30, 2018.""

""Orbit Determination results from this LAM firing are: apogee X perigee height was changed to 36412 km X 5054 km. Inclination is 11.93 deg. Orbital period is 12hr 45min,"" it had said.

ISRO did not spell out what went wrong.

Reports, however, suggest that the glitch was related to the satellite's power system after the second orbit-raising exercise yesterday, following which ISRO's top brass have reportedly gone into a huddle towards setting things right.

The orbit raising operation is carried out to hurl the satellite to its space home.

GSAT-6A, with a mission life of about 10 years, is designed to provide thrust to mobile communication through multi-beam coverage facility.

The satellite is also aimed at providing a platform for developing technologies such as demonstration of 6 m S-Band Unfurlable Antenna, hand-held ground terminals and network management techniques that could be useful in satellite-based mobile communication applications.

""GSAT-6A is a complement to GSAT6, already in orbit. These two satellites combined will provide a platform for development of advanced technologies,"" ISRO Chairman K Sivan had said post the launch.

This was the first mission for Sivan, who assumed charge of the space agency in January.

In August last year, India's mission to launch its backup navigation satellite IRNSS-1H on board PSLV-C39 ended in a failure after a technical fault on the final leg following a perfect launch.

ISRO had then said the heat shield had not separated on the final leg of the launch sequence and, as a result, IRNSS-1H had got stuck in the fourth stage of the rocket."

""The expansion (of Sterlite Copper, a unit of Vedanta) should not at all be allowed...if possible it will be good to close down this (existing) unit,"" he told reporters in Tuticorin.

Staunchly opposing the copper smelter plant's proposed expansion, he said lives of people were more important than producing copper.

The Makkal Neethi Maiyam chief asked ""what is the necessity to put up the plant near residential and agricultural zone? ...to say that the location is close to the port is not acceptable.""

He said he would reverberate the voice of the people against the plant wherever he went.

To a question, he said legal experts would also be consulted to see if there was any possibility for legal intervention in the issue.

Asked if his party had planned any protest over the Cauvery issue, Haasan said a meeting has been convened on April 4 at Tiruchirappalli to deliberate the matter.

Earlier, he visited A Kumarareddiapuram village in Tuticorn district and expressed solidarity with the people for their protest which entered the 49th day today.

Residents of the village have been demanding that the plant be shut down immediately alleging that they faced serious health issues due to pollution from the unit.

Haasan, addressing the protesters said he visited them as an individual and not as a party head.

""My humble view is that a business need not be run by ruining your lives,"" he said.

He said for him being humane was more important than being an actor.

""I am a Tamilian first. I have not come here as a politician. I have not come here for publicity. I have had enough publicity already,"" he said.

Haasan, apparently pointing to allegations of health issues due to the copper unit, said ""the injustice that is being perpetrated on you is a reflection of the ugly face of commercial greed.""

He said the central and state governments had not heard the voice of the people and that ""the people should make them hear the same now"".

Sterlite Copper's unit was shutdown on March 29 for 15 days for ""maintenance work."" The firm has since placed advertisements in dailies claiming that it has not violated any norms against the background of continuing protests.

Meanwhile, a protest demonstration was held in Chennai today by people of Tuticorin district.

Several men painted their faces showing 'blood' oozing out from their eyes to symbolically represent the alleged sufferings of the Tuticorin people due to pollution from the copper unit. They shouted slogans against the unit and held placards seeking government action to close it down.

Yesterday, the Tamil Nadu government had said that it was examining complaints of residents against the copper maker.

A leading copper producer, Sterlite Copper represents the copper unit of Vedanta Limited which operates a 400,000 Tonnes Per Annum plant in Tuticorin.

The company had recently said that the plant received the necessary regulatory clearances for expansion and its primary commitment was to ensure the development and well-being of all the communities around its operations.

Actor Rajinikanth yesterday took a dig apparently at the the ruling AIADMK over the issue of the expansion of the copper plant, saying the government was not responding to the protests by locals."

Speaking to PTI, Khosrowshahi said India is already among the top three markets (besides the US and Latin America) for Uber and accounts for 10 per cent of its trips globally.

""I can tell you that India is a key component of our growth plan. In fact, it is one of our healthiest markets in terms of growth rates. We have over 3 lakh active drivers and we currently do over 10 million weekly trips. We think, we can increase that by 5X or 10X over the next 10 years,"" he said.

Khosrowshahi emphasised that this expansion will require investment, ""but as you mature, you also want to combine that investment with eventual profitability"".

"" We think we're on a good road there, we just don't have a specific timeline in mind (for hitting profits). If anything, we're leaning forward in India,"" he said, adding that the company is confident about its competitive position in India.

Uber has been pumping in substantial funds to fuel its growth in India. In 2015, Uber announced an investment of USD 1 billion in the country to expand its services. It has also set up a response and support centre in Hyderabad with an investment of USD 50 million.

Asked whether a merger with Ola was on the cards, Khosrowshahi said the company will ""look at any deals that can add value to its partners and shareholders, but we believe in controlling our own destiny in India"".

There have been reports about Uber and rival Ola joining forces in the Indian market. The speculations got stronger after SoftBank - an investor in Ola - joined Uber as an investor committing over USD 1 billion. Apart from India, the two now also compete in the Australian market with Ola recently launching its services in Perth and Sydney.

According to sources, the two have help multiple rounds of discussions, including one just before Khosrowshahi's visit in February this year but the two parties are yet to strike a deal. Both, Ola and Uber have declined to comment on whether the two are engaged in merger discussions.

An Ola spokesperson said the company is always actively looking for opportunities for expansion of its footprint. ""Ola will always be an active and integral part for decades to come. SoftBank and all other investors are committed in realising this ambition,"" the spokesperson had added.

Last week, Uber announced a deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to rival Grab for a 27.5 per cent stake in the combined entity. Prior to the Grab deal, Uber exited two markets -- China and Russia.

Talking about the challenges in the Indian market, Khosrowshahi said the company needs to do more to get the app working for all Indians.

""Outside the US, we know that many riders have lower-end devices and are in areas with poor networks. Historically, we've not done a great job building for riders with those needs. That is changing, and we are committed to doing more,"" he added.

The top executive, who took over the reins of Uber in August last year, said the company is investing heavily in research and resources in the Indian market to build solutions for the local market.

He cited the example of 'Call to Ride', a feature being piloted in Pune that lets people make a voice call to book rides (instead of the usual practice of booking rides through the app) from popular locations by providing a code displayed on a sign at a booking point. The company is also actively exploring use of electric vehicles in India on its platform, he added.

"" India is one of the top three markets outside of the US, accounting for 10 per cent of its trips globally. For me, India is a core market that we are going to really focus on going forward. I'm really excited by the opportunity ahead for Uber in India in the years to come,"" he said."
200,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 07:12 PM IST",PTI,Services,"Fearing spike in NPAs, NBFCs & HFCs help realtors sell better","MUMBAI: Non-banking finance companies and mortgage lenders, which control the lion's share of developer loans, are using all the tricks in the marketing and finance trade books to help realtors still smarting from the pains inflicted by the note-ban, Rera and GST, to sell their inventory so that these lenders secure their monies.

According to a recent report, non-banking finance companies and pure-play mortgage lenders have an exposure of a whopping Rs 2.2 trillion of the Rs 4 trillion developer loans market, while commercial banks' exposure is much lower at Rs 1.8 trillion only.

These lenders fear that with so little demand in the market that is sitting on nearly 0.5 million units of unsold inventory, the chances of more and more developers going broke and their assets turning dud are higher in near future.

It can be noted that the realty sector saw a wave of reforms in recent past, beginning with the note-ban in November 2016, followed by the introduction of the Real Estate Regulatory Act (Rera) and the goods and services tax (GST), which have all badly hit the sector with new project launches and sales declining significantly.

""NBFCs which have lent to small and mid-sized developers will be in serious recovery mode. We believe that NPAs reported by NBFCs focused on the realty sector will increase in 2018. These lenders may also drive smaller firms to consolidate with reputed developers,"" Sahil Vora, founder and managing director of realty consultant SILA told PTI.

According to a report by property consultant JLL, as many as 440,000 residential units remained unsold across key cities at the end of 2017.

The number of unsold ready-to-move-in homes is estimated at 34,700 in the top seven metros of Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Kolkata.

According to a recent report by Ambit Capital, the total exposure of lenders to developer financing is Rs 4 trillion, with banks having an exposure of Rs 1.8 trillion and NBFCs and housing finance companies contributing the rest.

""While banks have been reducing their exposure, NBFCs have significantly increased their exposure to the realty sector backed by benign liquidity and interest rate environment of late. Seasoning and tenure of loans, city- and developer-wise exposures, and yields on loans show NBFCs/HFCs have significantly riskier real estate loan books than banks,"" Ambit Capital's Pankaj Agarwal said in the report.

Some of these NBFCs/HFCs like Piramal Capital and JM Financial among others are also running huge asset liability mismatches to the tune of two years, and rising bond yields can impact their margins further and so will be their asset quality, the report said.

Apart from these, Aditya Birla Capital, Edelweiss Capital, HDFC, Indiabulls Housing Finance, DHFL and IIFL, among also have higher exposure to developer loans.

Vora further said many firms have also engaged teams into project management and development, and other allied services to help developers to not only to assist in funding those but to also to ensure they achieve sales.

""Some have even assisted in providing home loans to buyers thus ensuring sales,"" he added.

Saurabh Gupta, vice-president and fund manager at IIFL Real Estate Practice said, ""We are always monitoring developers and wherever direct or indirect involvement is required, we have to step in.""

His company assists developers in various areas like sales, getting them introduced to a sales partner or private wealth partners so that inventory can move.

""Sometimes we show the developers the market trends so that they can reprice, resize or tweak the product design. Also, sometimes there can be capital engagement wherein the capital market players may suggest an alternative capital structure,"" said Gupta.

This structure, he added, can possibly move from a private equity loan to a construction finance loan or from a periodic EMI loan to a private equity loan where cash-flows are more aligned to an easier repayment structure.

Echoing similar views, Amit Goenka of Nisus Finance which is into project finance in the realty space, says NBFCs will have to help realtor drive sales to recover their loans.

""Advantage of NBFCs is that they can adopt various tools for corporate debt restructuring without resorting to refinancing as they are not under the purview of the regulations that guide the commercial banks.

""They can buyout inventory and sell them as they are not limited by product structures. NBFCs can thus innovate and come up with practical models to recover their money,"" he added."

Congress leader Pawan Khera said clarity was still missing in the paper leak case and this had led to chaos.

Questioning the silence of senior BJP leaders over the issue, he said Modi should answer the questions that were being raised.

""It is unfortunate that the youth of this country are turning (into) cynics. It's a serious matter. Arun Jaitley is quiet, so is Ravi Shankar Prasad ... and Smriti Irani is glum. So let Modiji answer and provide a solution for the youth,"" he said.

Alleging that the government was ""involved in full-time politics and part-time governance"", Khera accused it of keeping parents and students in the dark.

""Today, parents and students don't know what the government wants. (Prakash) Javadekarji says that other than those in Delhi and NCR no other child has to appear for a retest,"" he told reporters here.

But the Jharkhand police, he added, had said the leak affected students across India.

""Why is there no clarity? Don't they understand that they are playing with the future of our youth,"" he asked.

The Congress leader also referred to the arrest yesterday of Satish Pandey, an alleged ABVP leader who runs a coaching institute in Jharkhand.

""He is linked to the Sangh. Why did he have the paper? There are layers and layers of mysterious information in this,"" he said, adding that the last few days had seen the ""nationalisation of the Vyapam model of the BJP"".

""There is an involvement of government or leadership of the BJP. We demand an enquiry which will reveals the roots,"" he said.

Earlier, the HRD Ministry had said a preliminary enquiry had found that the CBSE paper leak was restricted to Delhi, NCR and Haryana, and if required retests would be held for the Class 10 mathematics paper in these regions in July. The retest for the Class 12 economics paper will be held across India on April 25, it said.

Khera also wondered if something that was leaked through social media platforms such as WhatsApp could be restricted to the Delhi-NCR region.

""Javadekarji, you come from a party where most of its leaders and supporters have gained all their education from WhatsApp university. And you are not understanding that it's scientifically impossible to restrict WhatsApp,"" he said.

Khera said the recent lathi-charge on a group of young protestors demonstrating against an alleged leak in a Staff Selection Commission (SSC) paper was ""criminal"" of the government. The government should have had a discussion with the protestors, he said.

The government should agree to a Supreme Court-monitored CBI enquiry into the SSC leak case, he said."

Handset maker OnePlus shared a video featuring its co-founder Carl Pei, who talks about how the company plans to ""re-imagine currency"". Towards the end of the video features a gold coin with the OnePlus logo to make it seem much more convincing.

Closer home, telecom operator Reliance Jio shared a video of 'Jio Juice' -- a new SIM card that would allow users to charge their phones wirelessly without carrying chargers and heavy power banks. The video has already been viewed over 2,600 times and received more than 2,300 likes. It was also re-tweeted over a thousand times.

Uber Eats, the food delivery arm of cab aggregator Uber, offered the world's first anti-ageing ice cream that the company claimed works on eight signs of ageing and asked interested customers to pre-order.

Uber's homegrown rival Ola, which pranked customers last year with 'Ola Wheels' for ultra-short commute inside corporate parks, said it was unveiling a hyperlocal news venture ONN.

The prank claimed that Ola News Network (ONN) would see over one million of Ola's driver partners across 110 cities double up as on-ground reporters, sharing local city developments in real-time. The campaign has already garnered over 108 million impressions.

To help commuters with their traffic woes, online automobile marketplace Droom offered a solution -- Droom Fly. The company claimed that these innovative hover shoes were capable of achieving a top speed of 80 km per hour, can fly up to an altitude of 1,000 feet and possess features like self-balancing, soft cushioning, fast-charging, and a battery life of up to five hours. Straight out of a science fiction bestseller, Droom offered these shoes at an introductory price of Rs 9,999."

Earlier, the Sena had fielded candidates against the BJP in the elections held in Goa, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat last year.

""Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had already announced that our party is going to contest elections independently and as a part of it, we have decided to go solo in Karnataka as well. We will contest around 50-60 seats but will support the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), which represents the Marathi people living in disputed areas between Maharashtra and Karnataka,"" he told reporters.

In a party resolution, Thackeray had announced that Sena would contest the 2019 Assembly and Lok Sabha elections on its own without a truck with the BJP.

The Sena, the oldest member of the NDA, shares power with the BJP in the Union and Maharashtra governments.

Maharashtra has been demanding handing over of Belgaum, Karvar and around 800 villages and hamlets currently in Karnataka, claiming that they are dominated by Martahi-speaking people.

The issue, festering since 1960 when the Centre adopted Linguistic Policy for formation of states, is pending before the supreme court.

Raut also appealed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis not to campaign for the BJP in the disputed areas in Karnataka.

""In every speech given by Maharashtra governor, the state government mentioned resolving the issue with Karnataka. If Fadnavis campaigns in this disputed area for the BJP, it would send a wrong message in Maharashtra as this act would be perceived contradictory to the official stance of the state government on the pending issue,"" he said.

Raut had recently demanded Belgaum and other border areas be declared as a Union Territory. However, his comments did not go down well with a section of people who filed a police complaint against him.

Referring to the controversy, the Rajya Sabha MP said, ""I was talking in the interest of 20 lakh Marathi people who reside there"".

Appealing political parties from Maharashtra to press for resolution of the Belgaum issue, the Sena leader said he was not bothered about a police case against him"

The BJP yesterday hit back at the PDP for its remarks that delay in resumption of a dialogue between India and Pakistan has the potential of undermining the Agenda of Alliance of the PDP-BJP government and said such remarks could lead to mistrust and add to confusion among the people.

""The decision to hold or not to hold talks with Pakistan is purely the Centre's prerogative and only the Government of India is in a position to take a call on this,"" Singh, the minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office, told reporters on the sidelines of the BJP State Working Committee meeting at Suchetgarh, near here.

Asked to comment on Mehbooba's statement that India should hold talks with Pakistan at the earliest, Singh said he ""is not qualified to answer whether or not and when India should hold talks with Pakistan because he is not privy to the sensitive inputs and confidential reports, based on which, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs take a view"".

He, however, said, any decision in this regard is beyond the purview of the J-K government.

Without naming any political party, Singh said even going by the ideological positions taken by Kashmir-centric political parties espousing demands such as autonomy, these parties have also, in their policy documents, left the management of foreign affairs to the central government.

Lauding the security forces for eliminating eight militants in a single operation in the Kashmir valley today, Singh said, ""Our security forces are doing a commendable job and the nation is eternally indebted to them.

""We are approaching the last phase of militancy,"" he said, claiming the common man in Kashmir, particularly the youth, has already moved ahead.

On the deliberations at the BJP State Working Committee meeting, the minister said the coalition government in the state has completed three years in office, even though it was being claimed by the opposition parties, particularly the Congress and the National Congress, that this government will not last even three days.

He said the working committee meeting, held every three months, was a part of the BJP's traditional curriculum offering an opportunity to review the activities and experiences and to chalk out the future road map accordingly.

At a function yesterday organised by a group of Kashmiri Pandits owing allegiance to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mehbooba said that war was never an option. ""Reconciliation is the mantra which we need to follow and therefore, I request Modi ji to engage with Pakistan,"" she said.

In a statement, BJP spokesperson Anil Gupta yesterday said, ""The BJP has refuted the repeated claims being made in the media by Sartaj Madani, PDP vice president, that dialogue with Pakistan was the first and last condition for forging alliance with the BJP.""

Madani had on Friday said that delay in resumption of dialogue between India and Pakistan has the potential of undermining the Agenda of Alliance (AoA) of the PDP-BJP government.

He had said the AoA was a commitment to the people to resolve the Kashmir problem through ""reconciliation and dialogue"".

The AoA, which formed the basis for PDP-BJP forming a government in Jammu and Kashmir, was an express commitment to the people of the state on resolution of Kashmir problem through reconciliation and dialogue, he had said.

Madani also said that a delay in resumption of sustainable dialogue and revival of peace initiatives between India and Pakistan were causing worries and had the potential of undermining the AoA.

Gupta responded by saying that such ""selective quoting from the AoA can lead to mistrust and add to confusion among the people"".

The BJP spokesman said he coalition government was formed without any pre-conditions to provide a stable and representative government that would work towards providing smart governance, ensuring self-sustaining and balanced development across the three regions of the state and to create conditions to facilitate resolution of all issues of J and K."
210,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 08:07 PM IST",,Science,Device that gives you cat-like 'hearing' abilities being developed,"Washington, April 1 (IANS) Researchers are developing atomically thin ""drumheads"", which are tens of trillions of times thinner than the human eardrum, and will provide cat-like hearing abilities to humans.

According to the results of the ongoing research published in the journal Science Advances, these ""drumheads"" would be able to receive and transmit signals across a radio frequency range far greater than what we can hear with the human ear.

Researchers at Case Western Reserve University in the US said that they achieved this cat-like 'hearing' with a device that is tens of trillions times (10 followed by 13 zeros) smaller in volume and 100,000 times thinner than the human eardrum.

""We need transducers that can handle signals without losing or compromising information at both the 'signal ceiling' (the highest level of an undistorted signal) and the 'noise floor' (the lowest detectable level),"" said corresponding author on a paper Philip Feng.

They constructed the device by exfoliating individual atomic layers from the bulk semiconductor crystal and using a combination of nanofabrication and micromanipulation techniques to suspend the atomic layers over micro-cavities pre-defined on a silicon wafer and then making electrical contacts to the devices.

""What we've done here is to show that some ultimately miniaturized, atomically thin electromechanical drumhead resonators can offer remarkably broad dynamic range, up to 110dB, at radio frequencies (RF) up to over 120MHz,"" Feng said.

""These dynamic ranges at RF are comparable to the broad dynamic range of human hearing capability in the audio bands.""

Human eardrums normally have dynamic range of about 60 to 100dB in the range of 10Hz to 10kHz, and our hearing quickly decreases outside this frequency range.

Other animals, such as the common house cat or beluga whale, can have comparable or even wider dynamic ranges in higher frequency bands.

The study also revealed that these incredibly small drumheads only need picoWatt up to nanoWatt level of RF power to sustain their high frequency oscillations.

The advances would likely contribute to making the next-generation of ultralow-power communications and sensory devices smaller and with greater detection and tuning ranges.

The space lab, will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere tomorrow, the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) said.

Tiangong-1 orbited at an average altitude of 167.6 kms. The space lab will mostly be burnt up in the atmosphere and it's highly unlikely to cause any damage on the ground, according to an article published by CMSEO recently.

With a weight of about eight tons, Tiangong-1 is much smaller the 80-ton Skylab and 140-ton Mir, and is unlikely to affect aviation activities or cause damage on the ground, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted CMSEO as saying.

As it continues to fall, the main structure of the spacecraft will be burnt or explode from increasing heat and friction. It normally disintegrates at an altitude of about 80 kms, it said.

The fragments will keep burning and most of them will be dissipated in the air. Only a small amount of debris will reach the ground, and will float down at a very slow speed due to their small mass, it said.

The European Space Agency forecast the space lab's re-entry for about 7.25 am China time on Monday.

Based on its current trajectory, scientists have said the space station could land anywhere from Australia to the US, with the southern part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula included in the strip of the US from northern California to Pennsylvania where it might crash down, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

Authorities in the US state of Michigan were taking no chances, however, and have put emergency teams on standby in preparation for the possibility of it landing on their patch, it said.

Launched in September 2011, Tiangong-1 was an experimental space lab with designed life of two years. The lab completed its main missions in June 2013.

China plans to finalise its space station to rival Mir, the Russian space station currently in orbit, by 2022."

""We strongly object to the terms and conditions set forth for the 15th (Rpt) 15th Finance Commission (FFC) that suggest 2011 population be taken as the base, GST be enhanced and welfare schemes for the poor be reduced.""

""Already the subsidy component for the poor has been reduced by one per cent last year. This shows the Centre has no real concern for the poor"", he said in a statement.

The FFC conditions enable enhancement in the Centre's revenue while slashing the states' share in Central taxes.

Moreover, the weightage proposed to be given to low income states would result in higher fund flow to non-performing states, he said.

This would be detrimental to the southern states, Yanamala observed.

The Centre claimed that devolution of funds rose from 32 to 42 per cent as per the 14th Finance Commission recommendation. But in reality the financial burden on the states increased by 30 per cent because the funding pattern for Centrally-sponsored schemes was made 60:40, he said.

""The Centre is trying to usurp the powers of the states. Is this cooperative federalism?"" he asked.

The Centre should consult with all states before formulating the FFC guidelines and do justice, he demanded.

Sivan said on Sunday.

""Data available with us shows that we can restore the communication link with the satellite as it is alive,"" Sivan told IANS here.

Earlier in the day, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) admitted belatedly that it lost the crucial link with GSAT-6A, two days after it was launched on Thursday on board the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) from its spaceport in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.

The satellite was to be placed in its intended orbit 36,000 km above ground level after three orbit-raising manoeuvres from the space agency's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan in Karnataka.

""The first two manoeuvres had worked as they were intended to but as the third manoeuvre was going to be fired, the satellite stopped responding.

""We are going through the data meticulously to establish a link with the satellite,"" said a confident Sivan.

Sivan, who took charge as the space agency's chief in January, however, said he was not aware if the mission to launch the 2,000kg GSAT-6A, which alone costed over Rs 240 crores, was insured.

Noting that a satellite usually communicated in a while after such glitches, the chairman said the GSAT-6A had not done yet.

""Our team at the MCF is continuously trying to establish the link,"" he said.

Complementing the GSAT-6 that was launched earlier in 2015, the GSAT-6A was to help provide the technologies for point-to-point communication.

""The functioning of GSAT-6 will remain as usual while we're trying to connect with the GSAT-6A,"" Sivan said.A

Only after the communication link is re-established, the satellite can be placed in its intended orbit.

With a life span of 10 years, the satellite was meant to provide platform for developing technologies that could be useful in satellite based mobile communication applications.

The police and forest department officials could not trace the 16-day-old boy during their day-long searches yesterday.

The family members of the new born first spotted the body floating in the 15-feet-deep well and retrieved it with the help of villagers, police said.

The eyewitnesses said the body bore an injury mark and was probably inside the well for over 24 hours, although it had not bloated.

After inquest, the police sent the body to Banki hospital for postmortem.

We are waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the cause of death of the baby, which had a premature birth under Cesarean section, said investigating officer Priyabrat Rout, adding, a case of unnatural death has been lodged in this connection.

It appeared the newborn might have slipped' from the clutches of the monkey and subsequently died after falling into the well, but the investigation is in progress and is taking all possibilities into consideration, the police said.

The baby was sleeping next to his mother in the house when the monkey allegedly carried him away. His mother said she saw the monkey fleeing with the baby and raised an alarm.

The villagers subsequently reported the incident to the authorities.

Alleging negligence on the part of forest department staff for not carrying out the searches properly, the villagers, headed by the deceased's father, meanwhile, staged a sit-in before the Damapada forest range office to seek compensation.

The villagers alleged that the monkey menace in and around Talabast village is rampant, causing frequent incidents of loss of life and property.

Banki, once considered to be the kitchen garden of twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, supplying fresh green vegetables, is now suffering due to monkey menaces, a villager said."

""Stalin says AIADMK should bring a no- trust motion (on Cauvery issue). We are ready to bring it,"" he told reporters at the airport.

In the same breath, the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker said Congress support was needed to facilitate such an initiative.

""Let Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi issue a statement (indicating support), they (DMK) are in alliance with them (Congress)... only if they (Congress) support, we will get the numbers,"" he said.

Seeking to make his party's position clear, Thambidruai, a senior AIADMK leader from Western Tamil Nadu, said such a no- trust move would however be only for the Cauvery issue.

""Only on the Cauvery issue... not for any other general issue. To urge constitution of the Cauvery Management Board, and since the Centre has failed to do that, we will consider that if other parties like Congress support it.""

Thambidurai's assertion comes against the backdrop of Congress ruled Karnataka going to the polls next month, where Cauvery is an emotive issue like in Tamil Nadu.

Days ago, Stalin had demanded that the ruling AIADMK support the no- trust move of the TDP to mount pressure on the Centre to set up the Cauvery Management Board.

The IMD, however, said the temperatures in east, east-central and southern India, which include Odisha, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, are likely to be lower than the usual, indicating that the onset of monsoon will be on time.

The ""above normal"" average temperatures prediction suggests that the warming of the summer season in northern and central India would be a continuation of the pattern seen over the past few years.

Last year was recorded as the hottest year so far by the IMD and other meteorological institutes across the country.

The previous year, 2016, was recorded as the hottest year since 1901. That year, Phalodi in Rajasthan had recorded 51 degrees Celsius, the highest-ever recorded in India by then.

The respite, according to the IMD prediction, is that the this year's average temperature, despite being ""above normal"" in most parts of India, would be slightly lower than 2017.

""Upcoming Hot Weather Season (April to June-AMJ) is expected to have the above normal sub-divisional average seasonal temperatures over most of the meteorological subdivisions of the country except the subdivisions of eastern, east central and southern parts for the country that are likely to experience slightly below normal seasonal temperatures,"" the IMD said in a bulletin.

Today's was the second seasonal forecast issued by the IMD for the upcoming summer season.

The mercury has started rocketing, reaching 40 degrees Celsius in parts of India, including in Delhi, in March, which is not considered as the summer season. This had prompted the meteorological department to issue a forecast on February 28.

IMD Director-General K J Ramesh said thunderstorms in east, east-central and southern India will keep these parts generally cooler.

""This is also an indication that the onset of monsoon will be on time,"" M Rajeevan, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said.

Severe heat-wave conditions in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have killed thousands of people over the past a few years. According to a government data released last year, 4,624 people died due to heat-wave between 2013 and 2017, of which 92 per cent of casualties were reported from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

""The AMJ seasonal average temperatures in most of the (meteorological) subdivisions are likely to be cooler than that of last year. Normal heatwave conditions are likely over core heat-wave zone of the country,"" the IMD bulletin added.

This, however, does not mean there will be no heat-waves this year. ""Usually, there are three-four heat-waves every year. This year, we expect it to remain the same,"" Rajeevan added.

Central and northern India are generally considered the core heat-wave zones.

After completing an MBA from Australia's Southern Cross University and leaving a cushy job to try inherit his father's political legacy, Shashwat is now in custody for his alleged act of instigating a riot in Bihar's Bhagalpur and surrendered in dramatic fashion on Saturday night after eluding police for several days.

Ashwini Choubey has been a four-time MLA from Bhagalpur from 1995 to 2014 till he won as an MP from Buxar. His son contested in his maiden election in 2015 on a BJP ticket from Bhagalpur but lost to Congress's Ajeet Sharma, who was a joint candidate of the JDU-RJD-INC alliance. ""This is Shashwat's attempt to return to political discourse in Bihar with BJP indulging in full-scale polarisation...he has been in the wilderness since the humiliating loss on his father's seat,"" a senior RJD leader in the state told ET.

The 37-year-old has no prior criminal history and no FIR against him and since 2015. He has been dabbling in various businesses like IT and a motorcycle dealership in Bhagalpur. He also has a engineering degree from Ranchi, a profile that does not fit with his alleged conduct during a procession a fortnight ago.

The facts of the incident so far show that it was Shashwat who had asked for permission from the district administration to take out a procession on Hindu New Year Day last month, and the said permission was denied. The police FIR says the procession was still led by Shashwat on March 17 into a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood in Bhagalpur and slogans like 'Hindustan Mein Rehna Hoga to Jai Sri Ram Kehna Hoga' and 'Topi Wale Bhi Bolenge Jai Sri Ram' were shouted next to a mosque.

Shashwat denies he shouted any slogan. The incident led to rioting in Bhagalpur and since then communal violence has been reported from various other parts of Bihar like Samastipur and Nalanda, piling up pressure on the Nitish Kumar government to act against such polarisation attempts by his alliance partner BJP. After his pleas for anticipatory bail were rejected, Shashwat surrendered before the police near a temple last midnight, wearing garlands and with his supporters shouting 'Jai Sri Ram' slogans.

The Indian Space Research Organisation lost communication with the satellite when it attempted to ignite the engine in a third and final move to its desired location after its March 29 textbook launch from the space port of Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh.

The second orbit raising operation of GSAT-6A was successfully carried out on Saturday, but when it was on course to normal operating configuration for the third and final firing scheduled for April 1, communication with the satellite was lost, the space agency said after maintaining unusual silence on the health of the satellite.

A satellite is placed in orbit in three phases.

""Efforts are underway to establish link with the satellite,"" Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO said on its website.

Speaking to PTI, ISRO Chairman K Sivan said preliminary data shows that there are chances of recovery,but establishing link with the satellite was the key.

""After the second manoeuvre when the satellite was in the normal mode, suddenly the link was cut....now we are trying to establish the link. Mission Control is on the job continuously,"" he said.

The ISRO Chief also pointed out that whenever there is disturbance, the satellite goes into ""safe mode"" and gets back immediately; however, it has not happened this time.

""Usually when these type of disturbances come, satellite will go into safe mode, then we establish the link and put the satellite back, but now we are not able to link, and that process is going on,"" he said.

""Once we are able to contact, then we will be able to do the further function,"" he added.

To a question on chances of recovery, Shivan said ""right now the preliminary data shows we have chance, we keep trying. First we have to get the link, that is the most important. Once it is there, we will be able to do the job.""

The 2,140-kg GSAT-6A rode piggyback on ISRO's powerful geosynchronous rocket (GSLV-F08) fitted with indigenous cryogenic engine at the third stage and was put into orbit successfully after the launch in what was described by a senior ISRO official as a ""magnificent mission"".

GSAT-6A is aimed at helping in mobile communication even from very remote locations through hand-held ground terminals and is considered a shot in the arm for the armed forces.

The space agency's unusual silence regarding the satellite had set off speculation about its health.

ISRO, which normally communicates on its website about the orbit raising operations like it did on March 30,following the success of the first orbit raising operation, had not released any update since then.

The last update was on March 30, where it said, ""The first orbit raising operation of GSAT-6A Satellite has been successfully carried out by Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) Engine firing for 2188 sec from 09:22hr IST on March 30, 2018.""

""Orbit Determination results from this LAM firing are: apogee X perigee height was changed to 36412 km X 5054 km. Inclination is 11.93 deg. Orbital period is 12hr 45min,"" it had said.

ISRO did not spell out what went wrong.

Reports, however, suggest that the glitch was related to the satellite's power system after the second orbit-raising exercise yesterday, following which ISRO's top brass have reportedly gone into a huddle towards setting things right.

The orbit raising operation is carried out to hurl the satellite to its space home.

GSAT-6A, with a mission life of about 10 years, is designed to provide thrust to mobile communication through multi-beam coverage facility.

The satellite is also aimed at providing a platform for developing technologies such as demonstration of 6 m S-Band Unfurlable Antenna, hand-held ground terminals and network management techniques that could be useful in satellite-based mobile communication applications.

""GSAT-6A is a complement to GSAT6, already in orbit.These two satellites combined will provide a platform for development of advanced technologies,"" ISRO Chairman K Sivan had said post the launch.

This was the first mission for Sivan, who assumed charge of the space agency in January.

In August last year, India's mission to launch its backup navigation satellite IRNSS-1H on board PSLV-C39 ended in a failure after a technical fault on the final leg following a perfect launch.

ISRO then said the heat shield had not separated on the final leg of the launch sequence and as a result, IRNSS-1H had got stuck in the fourth stage of the rocket."

""The contractual employment system is unjust. And it is going to be abolished (in government departments),"" he told representatives of employees' unions who had called on him at his residence in Bhopal.

He, however, did not give a time frame for the abolition but stated that a meeting with contractual employees would be convened soon.

Chouhan said one lakh jobs would be generated in various government departments. Recruitment of 31,000 teachers, assistant teachers and professors would be made soon and the vacancies would be advertised this month, he said.

The government had, yesterday, issued a statement claiming that it would recruit 89,000 people over the next a few months.

The decision to increase the retirement age has drawn criticism from the opposition Congress, and other parties, which said it amounted to ""deceiving"" the 1.5 crore educated, unemployed youth in Madhya Pradesh.

According to data tabled in the Legislative Assembly recently, only 19,226 people have got jobs in different government departments in the past 14 years of BJP rule, an average of 1,373 jobs per year.

The opposition Congress alleged that increasing the retirement age did not amount to much, with its chief spokesperson K K Mishra claiming that just 27 per cent of the 4.5 lakh government employees would benefit.

Mishra said the retirement age for doctors and nurses in the health department was already 65 years and 62 years respectively, while it was 62 in a few other departments.

He alleged that it had been increased because the state government was short of Rs 20,000 crore to pay retirement benefits to staffers on the verge of superannuating."

A case has been filed against Setalvad and Sabrang trustees by Ahmedabad Crime Branch on Friday night on the basis of a complaint lodged by her former close associate Raees Khan Pathan, the police said.

""We had received a complaint alleging that Setalvad and the trustees of her NGO, Sabrang Trust, used fraudulent means to get funds of Rs 1.4 crore from Union HRD Ministry between 2010 and 2013. Based on that, we registered an FIR against her and trustees of the NGO,"" said Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajdeepsinh Zala.

According to the complainant, Setalvad's NGO, which was given the grant for educational purposes, also distributed printed materials that could cause communal disharmony, Zala said.

The accused were booked under various sections of the IPC including 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) besides under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, he said.

Pathan had alleged that Setalvad and Sabrang Trust tried to ""mix religion with politics"" and spreading disharmony through the curricular material prepared for the erstwhile UPA government which had given it a grant of about Rs 1.4 crore.

The complaint had taken into account the report of a panel of the Ministry of Human Resource Development which in its finding has claimed that a prima facie case existed against her under section 153A and 153B of the IPC for promoting enmity on grounds of religion and making imputations and assertions, prejudicial to the national integration.

The sources said the Crime Branch of Ahmedabad police had sent a communication to the deputy secretary of the Department of School Education and Literacy under the Union HRD Ministry, urging it to ""furnish a point-wise reply on the application/ complaint at the earliest.""

The HRD Ministry in 2016 had sought the opinion of the top law officer endorsing the report of its three-member committee, saying ""the report of the inquiry committee is exhaustive and deals with every aspect of the matter and that action as suggested in the said report may be undertaken in terms of fixing liabilities/lapses, action for inciting disharmony and hatred and also for recovery of the money as is stipulated in the scheme itself"".

Pathan had filed the complaint last November with the Ahmedabad Crime Branch on the basis of the report against Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, officials of the Sabrang Trust and unknown officials of the HRD Ministry.

He had sought investigation into the alleged offence of criminal conspiracy, criminal misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust by public servants, promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, among others.

Pathan had alleged that a large amount from the HRD funding was used during 2008 to 2014 on 'Khoj' project of the Sabrang Trust under the scheme of 'National Policy on Education' in Maharashtra and Gujarat as well as on the 'Peace Building and conflict resolution' project.

The project was launched by Setalvad's NGO in some districts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Pathan had also claimed that a three-member panel, comprising Supreme Court lawyer Abhijit Bhattacharjee, Gujarat Central University Vice Chancellor S A Bari and HRD ministry official Gaya Prasad, had confirmed that the then officials of HRD Ministry in connivance with the trustees of Sabrang Trust illegally sanctioned the funds under the 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan'.

""Large amounts were also transferred as donation from Sabrang trust to Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), another NGO of Teesta Setalvad which too was used for various activities such as payment of salary to office staff in Gujarat, travelling expenses to riot victims of Gujarat, advocate fees and on various campaigns launched in Gujarat against the state government,"" Pathan's complaint had alleged.

The BJP also strongly criticised Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for going to Delhi at a time when parts of Bengal were facing communal tension.

""Almost seven days have passed since the violence but there have been no initiatives either from the state or the ruling party to help out the victims. They also showed complete lack of will in handling the unrest,"" BJP Vice-President Om Mathur, who led the four-member party committee to the affected areas, told reporters here.

""When such a big incident happened in Bengal, the Chief Minister is sitting in Delhi for five-six days, looking for political benefits. The BJP strongly condemns this and demands immediate and strict action against those involved in the violence,"" he said.

Mathur said there should not be one-sided action against a specific community.

""The actions of the government should not be one-sided. I have heard that people from a certain community are being charged under the Indian Penal Code and harrassed. Surely, the people of Bengal will give the Trinamool Congress the punishment it deserves at the right moment,"" Mathur claimed.

He urged the state government to start a relief fund for the affected, compensate for losses and provide proper shelter to those who lost their homes in the violence.

Echoing Mathur, BJP's Spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain claimed the Mamata Banerjee government is causing pain to the people of Bengal while the BJP is ""giving them the remedy"".

""When Bengal is burning with communal tension and police is playing the role of a spectator, instead of helping the state's people she is holding meeting with leaders in Delhi. Instead of leading Bengal, she is dreaming about leading Delhi. People of Bengal will not forgive her for this,"" he added.

Defying prohibitory orders, the four-member BJP team visited parts of Asansol in West Bardhaman district that witnessed large-scale violence and arson during a Ram Navami procession about a week ago.

A person was allegedly hacked to death while a Deputy Commissioner of Police lost a hand after being hit by a bomb during a clash. Several houses and shops were also vandalised.

The committee said it would prepare a report based on ground-level feedback and send it to the party leadership for scrutiny."

Among the charges mentioned was a three fold increase in crime in Karnataka, atrocities on Dalits, women and children, attacks on honest officials, killings of Hindutva activists, steep rise in farmers' suicides in the last three years, drug mafia ruling the roost in Bengaluru and poor infrastructure in the city.

Releasing the booklet, Union Minister for Law and Information and Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the Karnataka government has nothing to show to the public when it seeks votes from them for the May 12 assembly elections.

Speaking to reporters, he said ""Let me tell Siddaramaiah that you have not even four-five outstanding areas of achievements which you can convey (to the public)... you go everywhere (portraying) a negative BJP and negative Yeddyurappa.""

The Union Minister said Congress was losing its base across India due to 'misgovernance.' ""The record of the Congress is that it could not win a single seat in Tripura or a single seat in Nagaland a traditional pro-Congress bastion for the last 70 years. Congress could not perform in Nagaland and Meghalaya. Nagaland has 88 per cent Christian population,"" he said.

On the other hand, BJP is in power in 15 states while its allies are Chief Ministers in seven states, Prasad said.

State BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa, who also spoke, said the Siddaramaiah government has pushed Karnataka behind by at least 20 years in terms of development due to crumbling infrastructure and 'pathetic' law and order in the state."

While K Rathnam's resignation comes amidst allegations of a Rs 450-crore corruption in allocation of tenders and recruitment at the dairy, Parmar refuted the charges, and also said he stepped down not over these allegations, but because of family reasons.

A statement issued by the Amul Dairy said Jayen Mehta, senior general manager (planning and marketing), has been appointed as in-charge MD of Kaira Milk Union.

The KDCMPUL is one of the 18 District Co-operative Milk Producers' Unions federated to the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Limited, Anand, which markets milk and milk products under the ""Amul"" and ""Sagar"" brand.

Rathnam (55) told reporters that he resigned as he wanted to spend time with family living in Tamil Nadu and the United States. ""I have been thinking of resigning for sometime now.""

""I have worked for Amul for 22 years, and want to do something for myself in the next 10-15 years. I want to spend time with family members residing in the US and Tamil Nadu,"" he said.

Parmar said that Ratnam served as the MD for four years and had been speaking about wanting to spend time with his wife and daughter who live in the US.

""Considering all this, I told him I have no objection if he wants to quit,"" said Parmar.

The Amul Dairy statement also said Parmar refuted allegations of corruption as ""perpetuated by rumour-mongers.""

233,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 10:57 AM IST",ET Bureau,Panache,Free-range parenting makes a comeback; will it lead to more responsible upbringing?,"The chickens are finally coming home to roost. After years of parents being second-guessed by the authorities about how they bring up their progeny, a single US state so far, Utah, has passed what is being called the ‘free-range parenting’ law. In other words, what parents had been doing for generations and had recently been deprived of by many hyper-cautious Western nanny nations is being brought back under legal protection.

Not that ‘spare the rod, spoil the child’ sort of Victorian rules should become the norm again, but all parents should not be deemed so delinquent that they need to be told by a set of uniform laws how to raise their children, as so much of parenting is contextual. Whether kids go to school alone or play in parks without parental supervision can hardly have nationwide applications.

Logically, if chickens — who are not inclined to and equipped for as diverse a range of activities as humans — are healthier and happier with ‘free range’ lives, it stands to reason that children allowed greater independence (presuming adequate safeguards) will grow up to be more sound individuals.

And free-range parenting would also lead to more responsible upbringing. After all, many, if not most, of today’s parents and grandparents were not brought up by helicopter (hovering) mothers and fathers, and have lived to tell the tale."

First-choice point fielder. Once upon a time opening batter. Most times opening bowler. Almost Test centurion NSE -2.66 %. Part-time lawyer. Cancer-awareness advocate. And world’s No. 1 ODI bowler.

Most human beings would be happy with being just one or two of these. But simply by being herself, Jessica Jonassen ticks all of the above boxes.

“It’s part of who I am,” Jonassen told Economic Times a day before she helped Australia claim their first T20I series win since 2015. They did it in style too, putting up a world-record 209 in the first innings, eventually beating England by 57 runs. Jonassen, who bowls left-arm spin, had an economy of 7.5 despite bowling in the powerplay in many of the games in the series. In the preceding ODIs against India she was outstanding, topping the wicket charts with eight scalps, three clear of her competition. For perspective, Jonassen had more wickets than all of India’s frontline spinners put together. Known simply as Jess or JJ, her bowling has shown clear plans for both formats.

“It’s about building pressure, wickets will come after that. It’s important that you’re not searching for those wickets too hard,” she said.

But how do bowlers pick themselves up in a batter’s game, where the new playing conditions making it more challenging for them? “You almost have to take the ego out of it a little bit. As a bowler you generally don’t like going for runs, but on a field like this (Brabourne stadium, where the matches were played) you have to expect that and not go into your shell too much. It’s almost expected that even your good balls are going to go for boundaries,” Jonassen said.

The statement of self-identity at the beginning of this article has little to do with her considerable cricketing prowess though. It was about Jonassen being in a same-sex relationship. “I’m not going to hide that,” she said.

In February, she got engaged to her partner, and her Instagram feed features a number of photos of the happy couple. But six months ago, Australian laws did not recognise their right to marry. A November 2017 plebiscite changed that, with a postal vote giving the YES camp a 61.6 per cent majority. Jonassen’s Twitter banner image sports a large rainbow heart next to an equally colourful YES. Cricket Australia too threw their support behind the YES vote, as did more than 30 other sporting organisations.

“I guess I’m fortunate enough to live in Australia that’s recently passed marriage equality,” she shared. “And I feel for (the) people who are in same sex relationships in countries where it’s not supported.”

One of those countries is India, where Jonassen has spent the last three weeks. Far from same-sex marriages being discussed, homosexuality is still criminialised by law and a taboo at most dinner tables, and homophobic attacks are not unheard of. But despite the raised profiles of female cricketers meaning that she might be recognised on the street, Jonassen is not afraid of any backlash. “I don’t feel unsafe in the slightest over here.”

Her first line of defence is being comfortable with who she is. Her second? Cricket. “Over here, if you’re involved in cricket everybody almost bows down to you! It’s a pretty amazing place to be.”

And yet she is aware of the change that her visibility can create. “I guess we’re in a fortunate position to have some influence over the public. Hopefully we can have positive influence in a number of areas, not just in our on field performances, but who we are as people as well.” Bravery, the right amount of ego, and honesty are good qualities to have on the cricket field. Add that to Jonassen’s skill with the ball, and you have someone who is much more than the sum of her parts.

237,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 11:42 PM IST",PTI,Stocks,RBI likely to maintain status quo as inflation risks weigh,"NEW DELHI: The RBI is likely to keep interest rates unchanged in its first bimonthly monetary policy review for 2018-19 to be unveiled this week as hardening global crude oil prices continue to pose a risk to domestic inflation.

This would also be the first monetary policy announcement after the Budget, which has slightly deviated from the fiscal consolidation roadmap.

The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, is to meet on April 4 and 5.

Pressure has been mounting on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates in the wake of declining retail inflation and the need to fuel growth momentum.

However, the RBI will have to do a tightrope walk as globally interest rates are inching upwards.

Last month, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and signalled that it is on track to raise rates twice more in 2018.

Besides, the RBI has to take into consideration the rise in crude oil prices which temporarily touched $70 per barrel.

""We expect the MPC to keep policy rates on hold and maintain its neutral stance,"" analysts at American brokerage Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Bank of America Merill Lynch (BofAML) also echoed the view, but added that it expects a rate cut in the August review if the monsoons are favourable.

""We expect the RBI MPC to strike a balanced tone on April 5, with March quarter inflation set to average 4.6 per cent, 0.50 per cent below their 5.1 per cent forecast,"" it said.

After surging to a concerning 5.2 per cent in December, the headline inflation cooled off to 5.07 per cent in January and further to 4.4 per cent in February.

Even industry chambers are of the view that the central bank would opt for status quo as the government's budget announcement to provide farmers 1.5-times of minimum support price (MSP) for their produce may jack up inflation.

""This would leave very little leeway for the RBI to cut rates in this monetary policy and hence we expect the RBI to keep the key interest rates unchanged,"" Assocham said in a statement.

Currently, repo rate -- the short term lending rate at which RBI lends to banks -- stands at 6 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate is 5.75 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate stand at 6.25 per cent.

According to Kotak Mahindra Bank, the RBI is expected to be on an extended pause as inflation is likely to remain close to 4.5 per cent during 2018-19.

""We expect the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to maintain status quo as it awaits clarity on monsoon, sustainability of high crude oil prices post the winter squeeze, and global financial conditions,"" it said in a note.

The Patel-headed MPC has two other representatives from RBI -- Deputy Governor Viral Acharya and Executive Director Michael Debabrata Patra. The three external members are Chetan Ghate, Pami Dua and Ravindra Dholakia."
238,"Last Updated: Apr 01, 2018, 11:30 PM IST",ET Bureau,Energy,Power companies see better margins on soaring summer demand,"NEW DELHI: Power companies expect better margins this summer owing to higher electricity demand on the back of rising temperatures earlier than previous years.

The short-term electricity tariffs discovered by state distribution companies seeking supply of power in the summer months have broken many years’ record – at up to Rs 8 per unit. Short-term power prices have been hovering atRs 2-3 per unit levels in the last few summers. The prices touched a high of about Rs 10 per unit in the summer of 2009, also an election year. Before 2011, summer power prices were around Rs 6-7 per unit. After 2012, owing to the surplus generation capacity and subdued demand, the prices have been low.

However, this year, availability will be a key to power availability, said experts. Coal secretary Susheel Kumar told ET that coal in abundantly available. Power companies said though plants with power purchase agreements are getting coal as per the annual contracts the tariffs were high as many merchant plants were not able to bid for the short-term contracts due to lack of coal supplies.

Power secretary Ajay Bhalla said on an average, daily electricity demand in March was 10 GW higher than the demand registered in same month previous year.

“The coal-based generation has touched 123GW and the coal stocks are getting utilised fast,” he said. “Coal stocks at the power plants have improved to the level of 16 million tonnes with consistent efforts of the coal ministry, and the railways. Demand from farm sector has also been high. We have planned well for the year ahead, giving expected monthly coal demand data to both coal and railway ministries. We are also working on power plantwise expected requirement, which will be shared with coal and railway ministries.”

Weathermen have predicted harsh summer this year. The has forecast warmer-than-normal temperatures till May in various parts of the country. The summers have also approached earlier than the previous years with day and night temperatures above normal across many states.

Gujarat has tied up about 2,000-mw supply during April-June at tariffs ranging from Rs 4.79 per unit to Rs 8 per unit. The average price discovered is over Rs 5.5 per unit.

Punjab tied up short-term electricity supply during June-September at an average of Rs 4.5 per unit, while Haryana discovered tariff in the range of Rs 4.94 per unit to Rs 8 per unit. The average tariff was about Rs 5.5 per unit.

“Demand is recovering and showing an upward trend,” director general Ashok Khurana said. “The recent price discovery of short-term bids for supply from April to October confirm this. Adequacy of coal supplies to meet growing power requirements would be the key this summer.”

Kumar said Coal India has a stock of 55.5 mt and power plants have a closing stock of 16.5 mt. “Next year’s supply schedules has been prepared. There is no need to worry. Let us hope power demand next year remains as robust as this year,” he said."

With the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the nodal department for the exercise, set to announce the final rankings in May after assessing user feedback, these three states claim to have implemented 100% of the reform agenda mandated under the programme.

Nearly 8,000 randomly selected users across states are being interviewed face to face by a team engaged by the World Bank to verify the reforms implemented by the states.

This is the first time that government is gathering feedback on state reforms before it announces the final tally. The DIPP has also paired high performing states last year with those ranked low to facilitate learning and sharing between them.



Telangana, No. 1 state last year, has been clubbed with Tripura. Among others, Andhra has been paired with Kerala, West Bengal with Nagaland and Odisha with Manipur. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana tied for the first place in state rankings on reforms for ease of doing business in 2016, followed by Gujarat which had topped the charts in 2015.

As of now, the rankings which are dynamic and keep updating, show Gujarat at seventh and Andhra Pradesh at eighth place, with 99.5% reforms done. Telangana is currently placed ninth, having implemented 99.2% of the reforms.

In a tweet last month, Bengal chief minister said “regular and extensive monitoring, right from the grassroots level to the state secretariat level” ensured that “projects are implemented on time with minimum hassle”. She also tweeted, “Bengal continues to be number one in the country's ease if doing business, leaving behind the so called industry friendly states.""

The business reform action plan for states has 372 reform points to be implemented, including measures such as setting up of a single-window agency for all approvals, enacting the Public Delivery Guarantee Act and mandating joint inspection under 10 labour Acts.

“The reform points cover the entire lifecycle of a business … The feedback is being sought only on 78 reforms,” a senior DIPP official told ET. So far, 19 states have designed the information wizard providing information for all approvals, while 21 have implemented an online single-window system. As many as 16 states have stipulated a time limit of 45 days to provide construction permits and 21 have implemented a geographic information system to provide details about the land earmarked for industrial use."

While Round Two of the bidding is likely to include two original bidders, ArcelorMittal and Numetal, the dark horse in the race could be SSG Capital which can partner an interested bidder.

The Tatas too have evinced interest, according to lender sources, but it remains to be seen whether it translates into a binding bid. While ArcelorMittal is likely to go with Nippon Steel, members of the Numetal consortium are tipped to buy out Essar co-founder Ravi Ruia's son Rewant's 25% in Trust.

Essar's Committee of Creditors (CoC) has allowed all those who had submitted EoIs, like SSG , and the Tatas, to bid thus widening the fray. Top sources feel SSG Capital, a Hong Kong-based fund focused on India, China and S E Asia, could be a useful partner for any player keen on getting a wild card entry into the race.

While JSW Steel has said it was keen to bid for Essar in the second round, it did not submit EoI and hence cannot join the fray on its own. Vedanta, fresh from its success in Electrosteel Steels where it emerged as the highest bidder and was issued
a Letter of Intent on Saturday, is unlikely to bid.

While the price bids were not opened last time, banking sources said they expect this time around ""both Numetal and Arcelor are likely to improve their respective offers, entailing a lesser haircut for the lender banks.""

Both Numetal and ArcelorMittal, whose original bids were found ineligible, have moved the NCLT's Ahmedabad bench against the decision.

Top Numetal sources on Sunday told ET one of the options before it rebids could be ""buying out the stake of Aurora Trust by other consortium members"", led by Russia’s VTB Bank, Indo International and TyazhpromExport, a Russian trading and engineering firm. That would resolve the contentious issue of Numetal’s alleged links with the Essar promoter family.

However, the source did not want to disclose details of the revised shareholding pattern of the SPV. In a related development, on Friday, Odisha Slurry Pipeline, a key raw material transport link for Essar Hazira plant which Numetal had agreed to buy in February, offered to pay its entire dues of Rs 2,200 crore to a dozen odd banks by April 30.

The move, seen as an attempt to secure Numetal's bid, is however, likely to be opposed by lender banks. The latter feel this could queer the pitch for other bidders. Incidentally, none of the second round bids can be opened before NCLT Ahmedabad,
which has a scheduled hearing on Monday, decides on the eligibility issue.

While announcing its intent to rebid, ArcelorMittal said it remained confident about the eligibility of its original bid. The company said its disqualification was based ""on a technicality"" of being still being classified as a promoter of Uttam
Galva, an issue that has since been sorted out.

Minority shareholders of Uttam Galva approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal last week, alleging breach of listing regulations under Sebi’s Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 and sought a stay on approval to ArcelorMittal for selling stake in Uttam Galva. The SAT refused a stay on the promoter declassification and the next hearing is scheduled on April 23."

Four seers -- all aspiring for a nomination from the BJP - want to contest against incumbent ministers in the upcoming state assembly elections. While the saffron party has not made any commitment to these aspirants, it is the first time that people in religious robes are planning to contest elections in Karnataka in good number.
All the four seers also hail the work of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They are: Lakshmivara Tirtha Swami (Udupi), Basavananda Swami (Dharwad), Madara Chennaiah Swami (Chitradurga) and Rajashekarananda Swami (Dakshina Kannada). One of them, Basavananda Swami of Sri Guru Basava Mahamane, is visually challenged. The Lingayat seer wants to contest in Kalaghatagi Assembly against Labour minister and mining baron Santosh Lad. He had joined BJP in 2013 and wanted to contest parliament elections from Hassan against JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda. But the party did not give him ticket.





Lakshmivara Tirtha Swami, belongs to Shiroor Mutt, which is one of the most revered mutts of the Ashta Mutts of Udupi. If he contests the Assembly polls, he would be the first seer from Ashta Mutts to do so. His decision, however, has not gone down well with other seers of Ashta Mutts including senior most Vishwesha Thirtha Swami. He wants to contest against fisheries minister Pramod Madhwaraj, though he acknowledges Madhwaraj’s work as a minister.

Known for his fiery and controversial speeches, Rajashekarananda Swami of Vajradehi Mutt near Mangaluru is actively involved with right-wing outfit groups such as Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad. He wants to contest against forest minister and six-time MLA Ramanath Rai, who earned a bad name after stopping free midday meals to a temple-run school in Bantwal.

Madara Chennaiah Swami of Sri Shiva Sharana Madara Guru Peeta in Chitradurga district is another aspirant. A popular seer from Dalit community, he is close to both BS Yeddyurappa and KS Eshwarappa. Unlike other three seers, Madara Chennaiah Swami has not expressed his desire to contest assembly elections public. In his recent visit to state, Amit Shah had visited his mutt. He is expected contest from Holalkere (Reserved) seat in Chitradurga district, which is currently held by social welfare minister H Anjaneya. There is also a report that the BJP would field him in the 2019 parliament elections.

More Names

There are at least a couple of them who are willing to contest as an independent candidates or from the JDS ticket. Recently, Paramananda Ramarudha Swamy joined JDS hoping to get a ticket from Bilagi in Bagalkote district. Siddalinga Swamy, president of Sri Ram Sene and head of Karuneshwar Mutt, Andola is open about his plans to contest from Jewargi in Kalaburagi district. But there are not many instances where religious heads have won the elections in Karnataka. In 1983, Father Jacob Pallipurathu, who dedicated himself to social service, had won from Kalghatgi constituency against a Congress candidate”, recalls Clifford Pereira, who is actively involved in church affairs. Bernard Moras, outgoing archbishop of Bengaluru diocese says the church does not allow religious heads to contest elections."

The constituency, however, continues to suffer from rampant zonal regulation violations, encroached public spaces, traffic congestion and garbage mismanagement.

Carved out of the Varthur constituency in 2008 and named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who lived in Bengaluru, CV Raman Nagar is a BJP stronghold where a high concentration of pubs and commercial establishments have blended with residential areas. “We have over 70 pubs in just Indiranagar 12th Main Road, 100 Feet Road and 80 Feet Road put together.

263,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 07:08 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,"Amit Shah takes the fight to Siddaramaiah’s backyard, Old Mysuru","BJP president Amit Shah has taken the battle for Karnataka into a region where his party has had very little presence and in a twoday visit to Old Mysuru he seems to have made a mark with a plan to cash in on anti-incumbency in the region that chief minister Siddaramaiah considers his backyard.

Both Congress and former prime minister H D Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (Secular), which have been battling for control of the 66-seat Old Mysuru region for nearly two decades, are dismissive of any BJP impact here, but Shah’s visit may have queered the pitch.

Win or lose, his party seems to have a definite plan in place. It has identified some strong candidates in Mandya. For example, farmer and former Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader Nanjunde Gowda is to contest for BJP in Srirangapatna.

Shah visited the house of a farmer, Rajendrappa, who had committed suicide three years ago unable to repay loan, in this constituency. He collected a fistful of rice from the houses of five family members of Rajendrappa as part of the party’s programme, musthi dhaanya abhiyaan. “We will cook and eat this rice. We will have the food you gave us in our blood. And we promise to honour that and improve your circumstances,” he told the family. “Our government will prioritise farmers first, unlike Siddaramaiah.”

The distressed family expressed hope that the BJP president would keep his word on their welfare. While Rajendrappa’s son Madhu gave Shah a representation for a job and some financial compensation, his cousin Mamatha told ET: “We will vote for them(BJP) this time. Maybe they will waive our private sector bank loans which Siddaramaiah didn’t.”

Siddaramaiah did give Rs 5 lakh to the family from the state treasury as compensation three years ago and a temporary job for Madhu, while BJP’s chief minister face Yeddyurappa had given Rs 1 lakh. But that was not enough to repay the loan of Rs 12.50 lakh.

On the other hand, not all locals are convinced that BJP would make a big impact in the upcoming elections.

“People are talking of BJP yes, but the contest here is still between the JDS and Congress and that’s where the votes are divided,” said Cheluvegowda, a local from M Shettihalli village who went to “see Shah” in a couple of events. “Maybe the next election, we will see more of the BJP, though,” he told ET.

In Mandya city, where sitting MLA Ambareesh, a well-loved film star, of Congress is facing some amount of anti-incumbency, BJP is likely to field S C Madhuchandan whose organisation Organic Mandya has managed to empower about 9,000 farmers in the district and is leading a movement for “poison-free” Mandya.

Shah and Yeddyurappa attended an organic farming and women farmers’ cooperative meet organised by Madhuchandan. “Madhuanna”, as he is popularly known, told ET he would stand for the elections if he got the ticket.

In Mysuru city, BJP seems to be in a position to threaten Congress intwo constituencies. They are also strong in the four constituencies of Chamarajanagar district where there is a strong presence of Lingayats, the community that Yeddyurappa belongs to.

But both Congress and JD(S) deny any likely BJP impact in this region.

“Shah doesn’t know anything, he says whatever he wants,” Siddaramaiah told ET.

Sunil Kumar, a JD(S) local leader at Gungranl Chatra in Chamundeshwari constituency, said, “The fight is between Congress and us, that is all.”

But Shah’s visit has activated and sowed some seeds of BJP in this region. There is certainly Dalit resentment and a wary response from other backward castes. Even some of dominant community Vokkaligas, who have divided their support only between JDS and Congress so far, appear to be considering BJP.

Shah in his public and media interactions merely said: “Just wait and see.”"

The Congress high command is planning to announce the candidates by April 15 as the Central Election Authority, the body that clears the candidates, is slated to begin three meetings from April 11, sources said.

The AICC screening committee, headed by Madhusudan Mistry, is now in the process of scrutinising the list of shortlisted candidates for each constituency which has been sent to it by the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee on the basis of recommendations from the District Congress Committees and observers.

Siddaramaiah and the PCC team, fighting to buck the anti-incumbency burden, have favoured renomination of a large number of sitting Congress MLAs as they feel that their track-record and influence in the respective locality will make them qualify the “winnability” yardstick.

“Don’t expect large-scale chopping of sitting Congress MLAs in the candidates list. Barring a few, a large chunk of them will be fielded to fight this time too while we also make scope for many new faces, especially the youth, to fight the election this time. That is the spirit of recommendation from the PCC,” said a party leader involved in the exercise. The Congress will also give tickets to the seven JDS rebels who helped the party win a third Rajya Sabha seat from the state last week. While the sons of Siddaramaiah and senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge may make it to the list, the children of Congress leaders Veerappa Moily and Margarat Alva are learnt to be facing some stiff resistance from local leaders.

Apart from the traditional focus on its affiliated social segments including OBCs, Muslims, Dalits, the Congress list this time will give some “additional focus” on fielding more candidates from the Lingayat community. This comes in the wake of the state favouring minority status to the Lingayat community –– to which BJP chief ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa belongs to –- and leaving the ball in the court of the central government."
266,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 06:22 AM IST",ET Bureau,Ind'l Goods/Svs,RP changes bidding rules to keep Ruias out of race for Essar Steel,"MUMBAI: Ahead of fresh bids for Essar Steel on Monday, the resolution professional (RP) has incorporated a “new legal addendum” in the request for proposal (RFP) that may force VTB and other members of the Numetal consortium to exclude Rewant Ruia’s Aurora Enterprise Mauritius from the grouping.

The RFP prohibits any entity from transferring shares or management involvement directly or indirectly now or at any time in the future to the Ruias, or any connected persons. Any violation of this undertaking would lead to a cancellation of the bid and resolution plan. EThas reviewed the document.

Related parties could include “trusts, the beneficiaries of such trusts”, the document states.

The bidder will have to give an undertaking: “(I/we) have not and no person controlled by (me/us) has as of the date of this declaration, entered into any arrangement (whether written or verbal, contractual or otherwise) with any member of existing promoter group…”

It says: “Any breach of terms of this declaration shall, amongst others, render the resolution plan ineligible (whether or not it has been approved by committee of creditors or adjudicating authority) and prior to such approval, the RP shall have the right to reject the resolution plan without any liability.”


There has been speculation as well that Sajjan Jindal-led JSW may join forces with Numetal or may even bid on its own, having lost out on Bhushan Steel. JSW could be a replacement for the Ruia trust.

“JSW did not submit the initial expression of interest (EoI) like , Nippon Steel, Numetal, Vedanta and Tata Steel, and as per the RP they need to be EoIcompliant,” said an official involved in the bidding process. “JSW is exploring a structure that is beneficial for both Numetal and itself.” However, this could not be independently verified.

There was no response to emails sent to JSW, Essar and Numetal spokespersons on Sunday afternoon. Text messages sent to senior executives remained unanswered too. Essar Steel’s resolution professional did not respond to queries.

ET had reported on March 9 that the insolvency resolution professional will insist on certain conditions and undertakings as well as examine issues such as “negative control” via veto rights in connection with the bids for Essar Steel.

“The RP is taking extra caution to ensure there is no controversy,” said a lawyer involved in the matter. “The government has been clear it does not want errant promoters getting their companies back at half the price through bankruptcy proceedings.”

Sources close to Numetal said the consortium will comply with all norms but added that there are two matters pending before the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) — one challenging the disqualification, and a second urging that no financial bids be opened till the matter is heard and closed. The hearings are to be held on April 2 and 4.


Last month, lenders led by State Bank of India sought bids afresh from all the five entities that had submitted EoIs after the RP concluded that the only two offers in the first round — by ArcelorMittal and Numetal — were not compliant with Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

The provision bans promoters of defaulting companies as well as related parties and connected persons from bidding for stressed assets unless they clear their dues. Both ArcelorMittal and Numetal have said their bids were compliant with the rules and have legally challenged their disqualification.

For Numetal, Rewant Ruia’s participation was the bone of contention, giving rise to the impression that Numetal was a proxy for the promoter family. Numetal had rejected this characterisation.

However, VTB has said it’s open to making changes in the consortium if Aurora’s inclusion isn’t in line with the rules.

The bid came from a special purpose vehicle registered in Mauritius. Russia’s VTB Bank was to own a 40% stake in this SPV while Indo International Trading FZCO was to own another 25.1%. Another Russian entity had a 9.9% share with the remaining 25% to be held by Aurora, a trust based in Singapore, of which Rewant Ruia — son of Essar cofounder — was the beneficiary. Rewant Ruia didn’t control the trusteeship to reinforce the absence of related party involvement.

ArcelorMittal’s bid revolved around its status as a promoter in defaulting companies at the time that it made its offer."
267,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 06:22 AM IST",PTI,Politics,CBSE paper leak: Tale of friendship gone awry,"NEW DELHI: A desire to help their friend for a few thousand rupees led Rishabh and Rohit--the duo arrested in the CBSE paper leak case--commit the crime, a police official said today.

According to police, Rishabh, Rohit and Tauqeer knew each other since the last five years. Tauqeer, the third accused in the case, had urged the other two to help him get the CBSE Class 12 economics paper for his student. The official privy to the probe said the crime was committed for a few thousand rupees.

The police said that the invigilators are provided question papers at 9.45 am on the examination day and are allowed to open those immediately. The exam starts at 10.30 am.

However, the school (Mother Khajani Convent School) authorities allegedly provided the question papers to teachers around 9.10 am which gave the two accused -- Rohit and Rishabh -- ample time to click the pictures and send to Tauqeer, who circulated them to students, they said.

""We are also probing whether the trio was involved in leaking more papers this year or of the previous year's,"" he said.

Rishabh teaches physics at the Mother Khajani Convent School. He completed his B Tech from Punjab Technical University in 2013 and then did his BEd.

Rohit is a mathematics teacher in the same school. He had done his BSc from Bahadurgarh in Haryana, while Tauqeer teaches economics at a private tuition centre here.

The police added that the trio apparently was hatching the conspiracy for two weeks.

The leak of Class 10 mathematics and Class 12 economics papers has created a furore across the country, with students, parents and other stakeholders up in arms against the incident.

Though the CBSE has announced the date for the reexamination of the Class 12 paper, it is yet to take a final call on the retest of the Class 10 paper."
268,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 10:07 AM IST",PTI,Politics,"Dalit organisations call for Bandh on April 2: Bus, mobile internet services suspended in Punjab","CHANDIGARH: Several Dalit organisations have called for a 'bandh' tomorrow expressing concerns over the alleged ""dilution"" of SCs/STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act following which the Punjab government has ordered the suspension of bus services and mobile internet services.

In view of the Bharat Bandh call on April 2, the Punjab government has decided to suspend the services of public transport across the state tomorrow, an official spokesperson said here.

The PRTC, Punjab Roadways and PunBus buses would not ply on roads and the services of these buses would remain suspended tomorrow, he said.

The state government also ordered suspension of services on mobile internet (2G/3G,4G/DCMA), besides all SMS services and dongle services provided on mobile networks except voice calls from 5 pm today until 11 pm tomorrow, the official said.

The order to suspend mobile internet services has been taken to prevent spread of misinformation, rumours, through social media platforms and to prevent any disturbance of peace and public order in Punjab, Secretary (Home) Rahul Tiwari said.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh appealed to the people of the state, especially the members of the scheduled castes community, to maintain restraint and maintain law and order in the larger public interest.

""The government respects the sentiments of all people and their rights to express their views in a legitimate and peaceful manner, nothing should be done to endanger the hard earned atmosphere of peace and communal harmony in the state,"" Singh said in a statement here earlier.

The chief minister said the Punjab government was already committed for the welfare of Scheduled Castes, ""which was evident from the fact that the Punjab Vidhan Sabha unanimously adopted a resolution to express solidarity with our SC brethren during its recently concluded budget session seeking the NDA Government's intervention to legally pursue the case in which a Supreme Court verdict had diluted provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act"".

Singh further urged the SC Community and different associations to maintain peace, harmony and amity during the 'bandh'.

The Supreme Court on March 20 diluted the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, in a bid to protect honest public servants discharging bona fide duties from being blackmailed with false cases under the Act.

The apex court said government servants should not be arrested without prior sanction and private citizens too should be arrested only after an inquiry under the law.

But Dalit organisations, including the Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch, and some political parties fear the dilution of the provisions might lead to increase in violence against Dalits."
269,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 12:32 PM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,Govt to file review petition against SC/ST Act ruling on Monday,"NEW DELHI: The Central government will file a review petition tomorrow against the Supreme Court’s order on the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

The Apex Court’s judgement puts an end to immediate arrests in complaints filed under the SC/ST Act provisions.

After the Apex Court’s ruling, many BJP leaders and its allies had approached the Modi government to challenge the Supreme Court’s order. Government sources said that the government will file its review petition tomorrow.

Last week, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had shared that the Law Ministry has given an opinion in favour of filing a review petition. And that a go-ahead was given to the Ministry of Social Justice, the nodal Ministry to enforce the Act, to do so.

Prasad, speaking to media last week, had said “I have already instructed the Ministry of Law over the desirability of filing a review and appropriate follow-up action”. He added that the government had taken note of the Supreme Court’s judgement laying down new norms as per the Act.

The government had come under attack from Opposition demanding a review or bring an amendment to undo the Supreme Court’s ruling.

In its order a division bench of the Apex Court had banned automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the said Act.The ruling emphasised on holding a preliminary inquiry before taking any criminal action in this regard. The judgement had underlined the misuse of certain provisions of the Act for “vested interests”.

Contending that such a ruling would make the law, enacted for the SC/ST ineffective, Congress President Rahul Gandhi last week, leading a delegation, had met President Ram Nath Kovind seeking his immediate intervention.

Also, last Wednesday a delegation of Dalit Ministers and MPs led by Ram Vilas Paswan had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week seeking review of the Supreme Court’s order."

280,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 06:30 AM IST",ET Bureau,Analysis,Your fund’s track record may be irrelevant,"For mutual fund investors, a fund’s past track record plays a critical role when it comes to deciding on investing in it or continuing with a particular scheme. It shows whether the fund manager has been consistent in executing a particular strategy with good results. But what if the fund’s earlier return profile is no longer relevant to its mandate? With many funds currently undergoing a transition to comply with the regulator’s categorisation norms, this is likely to be a widespread issue in coming months.

At present, fund houses are busy positioning products into various buckets, which will strictly govern what type of securities they can hold in fund portfolios. Every fund house will now be allowed only a single fund in each category. Accordingly, some funds are either being renamed, reclassified, or both, to comply with the revised norms.

In many cases, a reclassification may involve a change in the fundamental attributes of the scheme. For instance, Magnum Global will shed its current midcap focus to become a MNC-focused fund with no particular market cap bias. So, it will now invest at least 80% of its corpus in companies with global ownership or where more than 50% of revenues come from abroad, apart from stocks listed abroad. As the fund transitions to this new thematic mandate, its portfolio will take on a different shape in the coming months.

Reliance Mid and Small Cap will now become a focused scheme in its new avatar as Reliance Focused Equity Fund. Currently a portfolio of around 60 stocks, the fund will have to cull its size sharply to reflect its new positioning. Reliance Regular Savings Fund-Equity Option, currently classified as a growth-style fund, will be moulded into a value-conscious offering under its revamped mandate as Reliance Value Fund. Similarly, many other funds will adopt a different investing focus and a significant shift in approach.

In this scenario, the track record of a fund could lose its relevance as it would no longer reflect the changed stance. To this extent, looking at past performance to assess a fund will become not just irrelevant but also misleading, points out Vidya Bala, Head – Mutual Fund Research, FundsIndia. Even a mid-cap fund transitioning to a large and mid-cap fund will not only have lower risks but lower return potential.





In such a scenario, investors will have to be more discerning about how they evaluate a fund’s performance. Since the past return profile would no longer be fit criteria to go by, investors will have to treat such funds as fresh offerings.

The new positioning will require the fund manager to adopt a different approach, so his past performance with the same fund cannot strictly be judged on the same lines. Bala says new investors picking funds on their own should go with funds that have not undergone any major change at this point in time.

For example, a fund that has been a multi-cap may be classified as a large and mid-cap fund now, but such a change is not significant. Some of the large-cap and mid-cap funds may already own sizeable chunks of each type of stocks to qualify in the large and mid-cap category. Certain funds being stamped as a ‘value’ or ‘focused’ were already running a similar underlying theme in their previous mandate. With minor tweaks to the portfolio, these schemes will be able to adhere to the new mandate without impacting their risk-return profile materially.

However, peer-sets may change which will not allow for meaningful comparison of performance with other funds. “Investors should stick to looking at fund returns versus the and avoid comparing with peers for the next few quarters,” Bala adds. For existing investors, the best bet is to let the fund houses come out with their changes and then reassess their portfolio based on the impact on their . For instance, if the reclassification results in higher large-cap exposure and lesser mid-cap presence than desired, then some rebalancing may be needed.

Jiju Vidyadharan, Senior Director, Research, Fixed Income and Fund Services, insists that a fund’s past record can yet provide a gauge of its repute in terms of performance and processes followed in the erstwhile category, which can be used as a reference point by investors for their investment decisions.

Also, these funds should be allowed some time to build a track record. “Investors will have to check if the reclassified schemes in their portfolio are aligned to their investment goals and risk-return expectations. If so, the investor should gauge the performance of the schemes over a period of time before making any decision to switch or commit more,” he suggests."

291,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 02:20 PM IST",ET Bureau,Analysis,Do FIIs generate more wealth than mutual fund managers?,"Selection of quality stocks is one of the biggest challenges in equity investing. Though there are several tools and ratios available to judge the operational and business strengths of a company, one has to use these tools in combination to arrive at meaningful insights. Not surprisingly, retail investors find such tools complex and difficult to comprehend.

For them, a simple method of identifying good stocks would be to track stocks in which institutional investor interest is growing. Institutional investors like FPIs, FIIs and domestic mutual funds have specialised personnel to track developments in equity markets, debt markets, global and the domestic economy.

Says Ajay Bodke, Chief Executive and Chief Portfolio Manager at Prabhudas Lilladher, ""Retail investors can look at stocks that form a part of the institutional investors’ portfolios as these stocks would have passed through stringent filters.""

What kind of filters do these institutional investors employ while selecting stocks? ""They tend to look at qualitative factors before delving into quantitative factors such as financials. Qualitative factors include corporate governance standards and the promoters’ approach towards minority shareholders over a period of time. Such factors play a major role in deciding whether the investment idea should be pursued further,"" says Bodke.








According to Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, different investors use different yardsticks. ""Earnings growth opportunity, quality of business, quality of management, opportunity size of the category in which the company is present and valuations at which the company is available are some of the common factors used to select investment ideas,"" he says.

Following institutional investors seems to be a good idea but which of the two—FPI/FIIs or domestic mutual funds are better in terms of shareholder wealth creation? We conducted a study to determine which of the two groups had better investment strategies and stock selection techniques. For this purpose, we considered listed companies with a market cap of more than Rs 500 crore and formed two groups.

Group 1 included companies where mutual funds have consistently reduced their stake and FPIs have consistently increased their stake over a span of five quarters, from December 2016 to December 2017. Group 2 contained companies where mutual funds have consistently increased their stake and FPIs have consistently reduced their stake during the same time frame.

After applying these filters, nine companies made it to group 1 and 20 made it to group 2. Between 30 December 2016 and 20 March 2018, group 1 delivered an average point-to-point return of 33% and group 2 delivered an average point-to-point return of 26%. BSE Sensex delivered 23.9% returns during the same period.

Both groups outperformed the market, thus representing the supremacy of institutional investors. However, FPIs emerged as better wealth creators compared to mutual funds. Did that imply that following the investment strategies of FIIs would be more fruitful for investors than following the strategies of domestic mutual funds? Duggad has a word of caution. ""The time frame chosen is just five quarters and drawing such broad conclusions will be risky unless the same is studied for a longer span.""








G. Pradeep Kumar, CEO of Union Asset Management Company feels it is not possible to generalise whether FIIs are better stock pickers or the DIIs. ""There are some fund managers and fund houses which over a period of time turn out to be better stock pickers because they follow a rigorous process and are disciplined in their approach. Many fund managers in India have managed to achieve this,"" he says.

Irrespective of the numbers favouring FIIs, none of our experts believed in the validity of the study. They were unanimous in their opinion that it was not easy to say that FIIs are better in stock selection compared to domestic mutual funds.

It is up to the retail investors to believe or not in the supremacy of FIIs over mutual funds. However, they can still pick good quality stocks by looking at the companies where these institutional investors are consistently increasing their stake. The data on such institutional investors’ stake is freely available on the BSE and NSE websites."
292,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 06:30 AM IST",ET Bureau,Analysis,"Indian investors need both active and passive funds: Anil Ghelani, DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund","Cost differential should not be the only factor to consider while investing. Passive investments should be added as a complimentary strategy in any investor’s portfolio, Anil Ghelani tells ET Wealth.

ETFs are relevant in efficient markets, where index outperformance is difficult. Where do these funds stand in India?
Multiple reasons have driven the growth of passive investments like index funds and ETFs in developed markets. There is a trend of managers finding it difficult to outperform the benchmark index, prompting investors to shift to lower cost passive funds.

In India, active management will continue to retain the potential to generate by outperforming the benchmark. However, this is becoming increasingly challenging, especially in the large-cap space. Recent analysis of large-cap performance shows more than 50% of the active funds underperformed the benchmark across 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods.

While the debate of active versus passive will continue, what Indian investors need is a blend of both. There is need to adopt both styles through a “core and satellite” portfolio management style to mitigate the of underperformance. The investor may expect better risk-adjusted returns by having a core portfolio of passive funds that grows in line with the broader market, ensuring index returns, and a satellite portfolio that attempts to generate alpha.

When we launched DSP BlackRock Equal Nifty 50 Fund, our first passive fund, we positioned it as a “complimentary” and not a competing strategy, with the aim to access large-cap equities in an investor’s portfolio.


The successful launch of the CPSE and Bharat 22 ETFs have highlighted the ease with which ETFs can be used as a vehicle to offload a basket of securities in the secondary market without having a negative impact on underlying stock prices. The phenomenal participation that these NFOs received has created a buzz around passive investing.


Worldover there has been a reduction in fees charged by both active and passive funds and this phenomena can be seen in India as well. The average fees charged by direct plans of active funds is 1.50% whereas those charged by direct plans of passive index funds on broad based indices like the is 0.25% and on differentiated smart beta indices like the Nifty 50 Equal Weight is 0.35%. However, cost differential should not be the only criteria and passive investments should be added as an effective complimentary strategy in any investor’s portfolio.


Most ETFs have authorised participants /market makers giving two-way quotes on the exchanges. There is also the option to approach the fund directly in case of subscription or redemption. As long as the underlying stocks comprising the index are liquid, getting in and out of the fund should be relatively easy.

The desired price at which this happens is largely dependent on the extent to which the market maker is able to hedge while providing quotes on the exchange. If the market maker is unable to hedge perfectly, a higher premium will be charged, which is reflected in the spreads at which the ETF trades. If a client has a long investment horizon, then real-time pricing might not be very critical. In order to avoid spreads charged by market makers, such investors could consider investing in an index fund based on a similar strategy instead of an ETF.


A low tracking error indicates that the underlying benchmark is being tracked closely by a fund. Passive fund returns can deviate from the benchmark returns to the extent of fees charged by the fund, corporate actions like dividends, change in index constituents, cash inflows/outflows, etc. It is important to have strong internal investment processes to manage these aspects and ensure low tracking error.


ETF growth in India started with the surge in ETFs, but subsequently it has been propelled only by equity ETFs. Regulators have not yet permitted products on any other commodities. However, this could change going forward. More commodities could be enabled, providing potential for innovation in terms of products based on a single commodity as well as a commodity-basket. The Finance Minister in his Budget speech announced the intention to use debt ETFs in the future whereby debt securities issued by the government and or PSU entities could be bundled in an ETF. This is likely to give a boost to fixed income ETFs.


While gold ETFs were popular initially, they subsequently fell out of favour. Besides return expectations, investment in gold ETFs was negatively impacted by the gold monetization scheme and introduction of sovereign gold bonds that give superior returns. Hence in my view, seeing a big growth in gold ETFs is not very likely going forward."

This will be the first ‘structured and collective’ meeting by these leaders after the Congress-led Opposition parties collected signatures for the impeachment motion.

The five allegations these parties have made in their proposed charge sheet include: CJI “arbitrarily using his authority” to allot sensitive cases to hand-picked judges by ignoring the senior brother judges; “forgery” in changing the date of a recent judicial order of much-importance to the government; “corrupt practice” in dealing with the case regarding Prasad Medical College; questionable conduct in the acquisition of land and compromising the independence of the Supreme Court.

While the acceptance of the notice for an impeachment motion is subject to the clearance from the chairman of Rajya Sabha and scrutiny by a committee of the charges, the Opposition leaders said, their very resolve itself will advertise to the whole world that they have lost confidence in the CJI and raise questions about his office vis-a-vis the government. Surely, signs are of an unprecedented fight getting intensified."

“This is a simple matter. The rules will be in place in two days,” Manan Mishra told the ET over the phone. However, a decision has yet to be made on whether to stop such lawyers from appearing before only the judge against whom they moved the motion or the entire court. As per a resolution adopted by the council, the rules will kick in only after an impeachment motion is admitted by the chair in either House.

The resolution was passed in response to a court notice on a plea by BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay, who first petitioned the council in vain to stop legislators from practicing as lawyers citing conflict of interest. Upadhyay, a lawyer himself, later moved the top court by way of a PIL. A bench, led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, issued a notice to the BCI asking its views.

Days after the Congress pushed for an impeachment motion against the CJI, the council in response to the notice said it would be tough to keep out all lawmakers from practice, but suggested that rules be framed to keep out those who were part of any impeachment process admitted by the House. “The only issue now remaining is whether the MPs or MLAs should be barred from appearing before that specific bench or the entire court,” the BCI chief said.

This is unlikely to go down well with lawmakers with flourishing legal practices such as Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, P Chidambaram and Vivek Tankha. The BCI resolution recorded the objections of Sibal, Singhvi and Tankha to any such move, though there was lack of clarity over who all signed the impeachment proposal.

Reacting to the development, senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the BCI should leave it to the lawyers concerned to voluntarily avoid appearing before the judge against whom they have signed impeachment motions."

The protests were also witnessed at Ambala and Rohtak in Haryana as well as in the common capital of Chandigarh.

Amid tight security arrangements, the Dalits held protests at Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Bathinda, Amritsar and Ferozepur in Punjab against the dilution of the Act.

The Supreme Court had on March 20 diluted certain provisions of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, in a bid to protect 'honest' public servants discharging bona fide duties from being blackmailed with false cases under the Act.

The verdict is being widely criticised by the Dalits and the Opposition who claim that the dilution of the Act will lead to more discrimination and crime against the backward community.

The Congress-led Punjab government had yesterday ordered a security clampdown as a precautionary measure, while the Army and paramilitary forces have been asked to be on standby to prevent any exigency.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had ordered that schools, colleges and other educational institutions would remain shut today, while the Internet services were suspended from 5 pm yesterday till 11 pm today.

CBSE postpones exams

Meanwhile, the CBSE postponed Class 12 and Class 10 examinations scheduled to be held today in Punjab at the request of the state government in view of the 'Bharat Bandh'.

""Taking cognisance of the letter of the director general (school education), the CBSE decided to postpone all class 12 and 10 examinations scheduled for April 2 , 2018 in the state of Punjab ,"" it said in a statement issued late in the night.

""Exams will carry on as per schedule in UT of Chandigarh and rest of the country,"" it said.

In a later development, the education department said the final practical examinations of Classes 10 and 12 of the Punjab School Education Board will be conducted on April 11 instead of April 2.

Transport takes a hit

Public and private transport remained off the road.

""Buses run by the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), Punjab Roadways, PunBus, and private operators will remain off the road during the bandh. Banks too will remain closed,"" an official spokesperson said.

The orders were issued after the chief minister reviewed the security arrangements with top police and administration officials last evening.

Chief Minister makes appeal

The chief minister appealed to the protestors not to take the law into their own hands, obstruct transport movement or harass commuters.

He also appealed to them that the mortal remains of the 39 Indians killed in Iraq which are expected to arrive in Amritsar today, be allowed to be transported to their native villages without any impediment.

As part of the elaborate security measures, four battalions each of the Rapid Action Force and the Border Security Force, and 12,000 additional police personnel will remain on duty to maintain law and order, an official spokesperson said."
303,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 06:59 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,Offices under sustained stress: Silence Of Chief Justice and Speaker causing deep damage,"Two Constitutionally mandated offices – the Chief Justice and the Speaker – are under sustained stress. This is both systemically unhealthy and dangerous, if not catastrophic in the long run.

So who is to blame? The convenient answer is to put it down to the growing bitterness among political parties and how they are willing to go to any length to undermine institutions. While there may be some merit in that argument, the truth is we are just a year before elections. The grammar of daily political conversation is obviously going to get competitive, scathing and combative.

Political parties will do what they must to win, which is why the onus to maintain constitutional decorum falls on institutions and specifically, on those who head them. They can’t duck responsibility and hope for the storm to pass. The Chief Justice is today a target of impeachment discussions. The merits of this effort aside, one has to question how did things come this far?

When the four seniormost SC judges did an unprecedented press conference in January, they signaled quite clearly that all wasn’t well in the haloed halls of the higher judiciary. Yet, little action, reaction or response followed – neither was there any corrective action based on grievances aired by the four judges nor was their admonishment by the office of CJI, if he felt what they did was wrong.

Either way, a response was needed to restore confidence in the institution. Instead, it was just expected to blow over, as though nothing much happened. Well, why blame political entities if they wish to make the most of this situation. Today, the higher judiciary runs the risk of being divided on political lines because the institution could not get its house in order. And, therefore, it’s no surprise that the first political target is the head of the institution, the CJI himself.

The outcome is of no consequence here. The fact that this haloed office will find itself under such scrutiny isn’t a desirable picture, though necessitated totally by the disinclination to address a larger problem. Quite similarly, the office of the Lok Sabha Speaker is under similar stress over whether or not to admit the No Confidence Motion (NCM). The inability to ensure a headcount because the house is not in order does send out mixed signals, especially when the BJP has said it’s willing to have a discussion.

Again, the issue is not on what’s the right call to take. That’s surely the Speaker’s prerogative. But what’s important is the process, the precedents and rules which are brought to bear in justifying a call, even if that means explaining why the house couldn’t be brought to order. Eventually, the narrative which builds is that a bunch of AIADMK MPs with a grouse over the Cauvery dispute didn’t allow a NCM headcount to happen. This is a weak argument that leaves a bad precedent.

The Speaker’s office came under similar duress when the UPA government pushed the Bill to divide Andhra Pradesh amid pandemonium, when house was actually ‘not in order’. That was the other extreme and it did great damage to the institution. The Speakers in Assemblies of AP and Telangana are today sitting on complaints of violation of anti-defection law, refusing to adjudicate for political reasons. And they see nothing wrong in doing so.

The Chief Justice and the Lok Sabha Speaker are two very important offices of the Constitution. They can ill afford to be reluctant participants in a crisis within their own precinct, for consequences will be far more damaging than what meets the eye."

“The fact is very simple. Some BCI officebearers — widely known as foot-soldiers of BJP establishment — first tried to get all Congress-affiliated lawyers banned from practicing law by bringing a proposal that MPs should not practice. That push was dismissed, so the same characters, smarting under the dismissal, now say Congress MPs, who signed the impeachment motion should not appear before the CJI’s court,” a Congress MP said on condition of anonymity.

He said the proposed ban is arbitrary “especially given the tradition of both lawyers and judges voluntarily recusing from matters where they are personally involved”. “BCI officebearers are virtually lame duck as their tenures are almost over,” a Congress leader said. Meanwhile, Congress, as a strategy, has not made all its legal luminaries in Parliament sign the impeachment motion proposal, keeping some for backup legal strategy, people in the know said.

For instance, when Kapil Sibal may have signed the proposed motion, Abhishek Singhvi may not have signed, even though both are on board with Congress move, they said. Similarly, Vivek Tankha and P Chidambaram may not have signed together.

Since only a minimum of 50 signatories needed for moving impeachment motion, the Congress effort has also been to reserve enough space for MPs of other like-minded Opposition parties to sigh as well to make it a “collective move”."

Referring to the use of ‘if and may be’ in the draft impeachment motion, former SC judge Nitte Santosh Hegde said, “impeachment cannot be moved on grounds of suspicion”. However, he added that he would have refrained from conducting himself in the manner the CJI did. “Notwithstanding that allocation of work is a matter of discretion (of the CJI), if I were the CJI, I would have not have acted as alleged in the draft impeachment motion,” he added.

Making it clear that he is “not holding a brief for the current CJI”, he added: “Such accusations cannot institute an impeachment motion. For, they will tantamount to denigrating the judiciary”. Elaborating, he said “impeachment can be moved on grounds of proven misconduct. In the instant case, the complainant himself is not certain about the veracity of his allegations. I am against such roving inquires. This is not fair.”

Known for his bold judgements, Justice AP Shah, former chief justice of Delhi High Court does not view Opposition’s impeachment move as a transgression. He says, “the right to move an impeachment motion is a handle provided itself by the Judiciary to the political class.” On the charges levelled by the Opposition, Shah referred to the complaint made by advocate Prashant Bhushan’s Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms. “If the charges are going to be the same as mentioned in the complaint of CJAR, then they are all serious (charges).

From the alleged involvement in the medical scam to charges of conflict of interest (that CJI should not have taken up the matter), if any of the charges is proved it will be sufficient to warrant his removal” Justice (retd) Shah said. For, he added, this will tantamount to abuse of power as master of the roster. He said “I don’t know how this (impeachment motion) will play out. Another retired Supreme Court judge, requesting anonymity, shared his views on the issue.

“An impeachment motion shall not be reduced to an instrument of intimidation. It cannot be allowed to be misused as a handle to defang the judiciary. If the charges are serious, the political class is free to pursue an impeachment motion. Whether it makes the cut or not is a different proposition. But politicians ought to keep politics away from such serious affairs,” he said."

The standing committee, headed by BJP MP Anurag Thakur, is scheduled to meet next on April 6 when it will be briefed on citizens’ data security and privacy by officials from the ministry of electronics and information technology.

Based on this presentation and after discussing the issue, the panel will decide on calling Facebook to India representatives to examine the matter further.

The development comes against the backdrop of the Congress and the BJP levelling charges and counter-charges against one another on hiring Cambridge Analytica and its associated firms for their election campaigning.

Former top employees of Cambridge Analytica have said the company employed various dubious means — including sex, sleaze and allurements — to help its client political parties win elections. Facebook data on potential voters was also reportedly used by the company to target potential voters.

BJP had raked up this issue after Cambridge Analytica faced charges of using all means to help Republican candidate Donald Trump win the US Presidential elections and it came to light that the firm and its affiliates were active in other countries, including India, as well.


Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that Congress had engaged in data manipulation and theft in elections and asked it to come clean on the charges. Congress hit back, alleging that the BJP is engaging in “Goebbelsian” tactics and this is a ""fake agenda, a white lie"".

Congress chief Rahul Gandhi charged the BJP of bringing up this issue to divert attention from the death of 39 Indian migrants in Iraq.

This is not the first time that Facebook is faced with the challenge of being summoned by the Parliamentary Standing Committee.

“In the past also, we had summoned Facebook representatives on the issue of net neutrality. As is done in the UK (India’s Parliamentary system is based on the British model), all stakeholders were asked to appear before the committee when the net neutrality issue was dealt with. We will do so again if required,” Thakur told ET.

The law minister has already warned Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg that if any wrongdoing is found, those responsible will be hauled up.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has been dealing with the issue of data privacy for the past few months.

In January 2017, the panel discussed the issue of digital payments and online security of data. “We want to deal with the current issue of data privacy in a time bound manner,” Thakur said."
309,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 07:19 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,"Ending Hazare's fast: BJP got it right by engaging Fadnavis, UPA suffered for ignoring Vilasrao","MUMBAI: In April 2011, when social activist Anna Hazare began his fast unto death to demand for a Lokpal bill, the then Congress government at the Centre froze, sending emissary after emissary to convince him. However, Anna did not budge. The Centre finally buckled and gave in to his demands.

Six years later, faced with a similar situation, the BJP government at the Centre managed to quell Hazare’s protest without much controversy. Ironically, in doing so, the BJP took a leaf out of senior Congress leader late Vilasrao Deshmukh’s own book on how to deal with Hazare.

A month back when Anna Hazare first announced that he would go on fast in Delhi, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis sent in his close confidant, Minister of Water Resources Girish Mahajan, assuring Hazare that his demands would be looked into. Mahajan held two one-onone meetings with Hazare, and according to BJP leaders, assured the striking activist that the Centre would fulfill all his demands. However, with no concrete assurance about timeline coming, Hazare told Mahajan that he would go ahead with the fast.

The BJP however, did not give up. Even when Hazare went to Delhi, Fadnavis, in consultations with the BJP top brass, sent Mahajan to Delhi to be in touch with Hazare. Mahajan was ensconced at Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi for most part of Hazare’s agitation. BJP leaders said that he again got in touch with Hazare on March 24, the second day of his agitation. According to those who were witness to the negotiations, Hazare was told by Mahajan that the Centre had in-principle accepted all his demands on higher remuneration for farmers and electoral reforms.

However, Hazare did not back down because Mahajan’s offer had nothing on the Lokpal issue. Getting nothing on Lokpal bill would have been a loss of face for Hazare. Sensing this, the BJP brass sent another offer, this time a letter from the PMO signed by Jitendra Singh. Sources said the draft was shown to Hazare on March 27, and the fast was ended on March 30. Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis specially flew to Delhi and offered him coconut water to mark the end of the fast.

Old Congress hands said the BJP only followed the script of late Vilasrao Deshmukh, who as Chief Minister, had handled many similar fasts of Hazare. “What Vilasrao did was simple. He employed a direct communication with Hazare even before he went on fast. He did not try to use force to stop the fast sensing that it could lead to a bigger problem. He kept Anna in good humour and agreed to most of his demands on the fourth or sixth day of the fast. This way both went home happy,” said the Congress leader.

According to him, the main difference between how Congress and BJP handled the stirs was that Congress leaders did not involve Vilasrao and spoke to leaders other than Anna. “In 2011, they did not use Vilasrao and communicated with Kejriwal and others. Anna was not kept in the loop that I believe was the crucial difference. Also, it was important that you establish a line of communication with Anna even before his agitation begins. This is very important. If he feels ignored by the government, then it becomes a ego issue.”said a Congress leader.

For the record, the letter signed by Jitendra Singh to Hazare has nothing concrete on the Lokpal. It has only assured that the government would try to resolve the matter in another six months. Though Anna Hazare has said that he would be back again if the government doesn’t fulfill the demand in that time, the government could at least convince him to end the strike."

Sweet talk
There was a time when war was the only answer. But since 1945 (the end of the Second World War), due to the collective effort of great powers, there have been no major battles. “For the first time in history, you are your worst enemies. Fewer people died in 2017 due to UN violence than due to obesity, car accidents and suicides,” he said. “Statistically, you have a greater chance of killing yourself than any soldier or terrorist. Sugar is a greater danger than gunpowder. You are more likely to die from drinking too much cola than being blown up by al-Qaeda. And this is very good news.”

Of course, there is no guarantee that this state of affairs will continue. This achievement, made possible by global cooperation of nations, must be protected, according to Harari. “Youshould never underestimate human stupidity. It’s one of the most powerful forces in human history,” he said.

The ecological challenge
Nuclear war is a possibility. Climate change is here, and now, making it a more immediate threat to the existence of humans. “Homo sapiens have proven to be ecological serial killers for thousands of years. We are responsible for the extinction of numerous plants and animals. Now we are putting in danger the survival of our species as well as much of life on earth,” he said.

“Climate change and ecological collapse are a present reality. It is already happening all around us. If things continue in present course, in 50 years, it might be impossible to live in Mumbai. Either because the Indian Ocean will rise and swallow up much of the city or because it will be so hot, that nobody could live here.”

No single nation can prevent this as they are not ecological sovereigns. They are dependent on each other and hence need each other.

Technological disruption
Advancements in AI and bioengineering are two key challenges of the future. “AI may completely disrupt the global job market as computers and robots outperform humans. Billions of people may be pushed out of the job market. And we will see the creation of an enormous new class — the useless class. Just as the industrial revolution of the 19th century created the urban working class, the automation revolution of the 21st century may create the useless class. Useless, not from the perspective of their loved ones, but from the economic and political viewpoint. There could be millions of people who have no economic value and hence, no political power,” Harari said."

The chief minister of West Bengal has already drawn up her national plans.

Following her Delhi trip, Banerjee will travel to Chennai to meet DMK chief M Karunanidhi and then to Hyderabad to hold a reciprocal meeting with Telengana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, who had come down to Kolkata to discuss the Opposition’s front with Banerjee.

However, political observers are betting on her meetings in Lucknow. According to sources in TMC ranks, Banerjee will hold a highlevel meeting with Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati to seal the electoral alliance between the leaders in Uttar Pradesh.

During her visit to Delhi, Banerjee mentioned that she is willing to go to Lucknow and meet both the leaders, if they agree to come on the same platform.

According to Kiranmoy Nanda, SP’s national vice-president, his party has already taken athe decision to go for an electoral alliance with Mayawati’s BSP in the general elections.

“Mamata Banerjee is not only the chief minister of Bengal, she is also a national leader. She understands the significance of Uttar Pradesh in the upcoming general elections,” he added.

According to sources, Banerjee will visit Lucknow at the end of April.

With Banerjee taking a lead in bringing all Opposition parties together and forming the federal front without the direct support from the Congress, political observers feel she is going to be a strong contender for holding a leadership position in the front.

According to a senior leader in the Trinamool Congress, Banerjee is likely to bargain for her position post-election, but in this pre-election scenario, Didi’s only aim is to get the strong regional forces together to take on the BJP.

“As far as the leadership for the coalition of regional parties is concerned, there are already five names one can count. Apart from Mamata Banerjee, there are big names such as Mayawati, Chandrababu Naidu, Rahul Gandhi and Sharad Pawar.

“If the Congress agrees to become a part of this front, it will be difficult to ignore Rahul Gandhi’s claims. If he voluntarily agrees to be led by the regional party, then only the TMC and others will agree to get the Congress on board,” said a senior leader of the TMC.

“In this kind of a front, the regional parties can only bargain with the Congress post elections if they secure more seats,” he added."

BJP sources said he is likely to figure as a party candidate from one of the Assembly seats in Indore.

Among the seats he is said to be interested in are Indore-3, Depalpur and Rau. While Rau was won by the Congress in 2013, the other two seats are with the BJP. In August 2014, Mandar was in the midst of a controversy after objections from some quarters over the decision of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to nominate him to the Madhya Pradesh State Wildlife Advisory Board.

Sumitra Mahajan, who will turn 75 on April 12, is in the eye of a storm these days for adjourning the Lok Sabha on eight consecutive working days without taking up notices for moving a no-confidence by the TDP the YSRCP and the Congress. BJP sources said that if Mandar gets a ticket, he stands a good chance of winning the elections as his mother has represented Indore Lok Sabha constituency eight times since 1989.

Indore-3 Assembly seat falls in the area where the Mahajans have lived for more than two decades. Depalpur is also a safe seat for the BJP.

However, BJP’s policy of having only one member of a family as an office-bearer in the party may come in Mandar’s way. This rule has been broken in the case of leaders such as Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh, whose son Rajbir is an MP and grandson Sandeep a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government in UP."

316,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 07:41 AM IST",ET Bureau,Company,Reliance Jio's move to extend loyalty plan for free may hit ARPU,"KOLKATA: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s free extension of its ‘Prime’ loyalty programme for existing members for another year from April 1 is set to trigger a minimum 8-10% sequential dip in its average revenue per user (ARPU) in the first quarter of FY19, said analysts.

They added that Jio’s latest move underlines its dogged determination to hold on to its existing base of over 175 million customers and acquire more in the coming months from rival incumbents, signalling that price wars in the telecom industry won’t be easing any time soon.

On Friday, Jio had said its loyalty programme, Prime, would remain free for existing members for another year, while it would be offered to new ones for a one-time fee of Rs 99. “Jio should see an ARPU dilution of 8-10% sequentially in the April-June period following its decision to waive the Rs 99 renewal fee for all existing members,” said Naveen Kulkarni, telecom analyst at PhillipCapital.

Another senior analyst, who did not wish to be named, estimated an “11-12% on-quarter ARPU fall” since Jio had “recognised the one-time Rs 99 annual membership fee from existing Prime customers on an accelerated basis”. “While Jio recognised the annual membership fees of existing Prime customers who came on board in April 2017 over a 12-month span, there were many customers who possibly opted for Prime as late as December 2017 or January/February 2018, whose onetime membership fees were recognised in just 2-4 months, which aided the company’s healthy ARPU growth in FY18,” he said.



Accordingly, Jio’s ARPU fall in the first quarter of FY19, he said, is likely to be sharp, as “this revenue will go off the April 1, 2018, following the free extension for existing Prime members. Analysts reckoned Jio’s monthly ARPU in the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31 could see a near 7% sequential dip to Rs 143-144 — from Rs 154 in the October-December quarter — following its ultra-low Rs 49/month offer to JioPhone users and its equally aggressive Rs 98/month entry level 4G price plan unveiled in January. At press time, Jio did not reply to ET’s queries.

The 4G newcomer had started enrolling Prime customers from April 2017 for a one time entry fee of `99 when it started charging for data services, and the loyalty programme was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2018. Nitin Soni, director at global rating agency, Fitch, said “the free extension of the Prime loyalty programme for existing members suggests Jio is not too worried about sacrificing revenue and profitability in the short-term in its bid to retain and chase customers and close the gap with market leader Bharti Airtel”.

Jio’s relentless aggression on the pricing front, he said, “does not bode well” for the financially-stressed incumbent carriers Bharti Airtel, India and Idea Cellular, who are “unlikely to get any respite from the brutal price wars in the coming quarters”. The country’s beleaguered telecom industry has remained in the grip of fierce price wars following Jio’s entry over a year back, and is saddled with a whopping Rs 8 lakhcrore of debt.

Unlike Reliance Jio’s strong ARPU of Rs 154 in the October-December quarter, Bharti Airtel’s fell to Rs 123, while both Vodafone India and Idea recorded ARPUs of `114 each, hit by the cut in interconnect charges, which exacerbated pressures on their voice and data businesses amid continuing price competition."

The agency, which is likely to examine Chanda Kochhar soon, may also call officials of other banks in the 20-member consortium, they said. This is to ascertain whether any influence was exerted on them to fund Videocon.

Meanwhile, sources said CBI will call Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI Bank NSE -0.25 % chief Chanda Kochhar, shortly for examination. The consortium was led by State Bank of India and included ICICI Bank. Its members in 2012 had sanctioned Rs 40,000 crore to Videocon.

Some of these have since turned non-performing assets for banks. The CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry to probe an alleged nexus between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot. It also names some unknown ICICI Bank officials, but not Chanda Kochhar.

ICICI Bank board has dismissed allegations of nepotism or favouritism in the loan deals, dubbing those as “unfounded and malicious”. Dhoot has denied any wrongdoing. CBI sources said examining officials of other lenders may help throw light onto the reasons behind them giving loan to Videocon.

A preliminary enquiry is a precursor to registration of an FIR. The agency can close the probe if it does not find merit in the accusations."

An ET poll conducted among 23 market participants suggests that the central bank may be headed into an extended pause on rate action even though the US Federal Reserve is penciling in higher borrowing costs in the world’s biggest economy toward the latter half of the year. Should the Monetary Police Committee (MPC) of the RBI hold rates at what they now are at its conclave beginning April 4, it would be the fourth such consecutive policy decision.

“The MPC is expected to strike a balanced approach as inflation in the January-March quarter (Q1-2018) has undershot its target,” said Anubhuti Sahay, chief India economist at Standard Chartered Bank. “Additionally, growth recovery… in a nascent stage is also likely to keep the MPC away from striking a hawkish note. But it will remain vigilant of risks to inflation and fiscal deficit on the impending announcement on minimum support prices (MSP).”

This year’s made a key announcement, pegging the MSP for farmers at 1.5 times the cost. This move could well be inflationary as prices available to farmers for their harvest could increase by about 15 per cent, according to an estimate by the government’s think-tank NITI Aayog. This may result in an increase in farmers’ income by 24 per cent.

“Elevated oil prices, substantial increases in MSP, and Pay Commission payouts collectively pose a risk to inflation estimates,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank. “There is enough inflation pressure in the system and those risks could well materialise. The RBI can afford to stay neutral for now while the … beneficial base effect could operate after June.”

India is grappling with twin deficits, with New Delhi spending more than its revenues and importing more goods than it is shipping out. Such a situation puts further pressure on consumer prices.

“Inflation has been more moderate than earlier feared, although multiple risks remain,” said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank. “Given this, the policy tone is unlikely to be more hawkish than before, but will keep its focus on the evolving risks.”

Retail inflation, a key gauge considered by the six-member MPC while deciding its policy stance, was estimated to be 5.1 per cent during the Jan-March quarter. It has trended lower to 4.4 per cent in February.

To be sure, this moderation could well mean a temporary reprieve. Since then, oil prices have surged, with Brent crude hovering around $70 a barrel. The majority of poll participants anticipate an extended pause, although the markets would be keen to know how individual members voted.

“The interesting aspects of this policy will be the voting pattern of the MPC members as that might be a signal on future action probabilities,” said Bhattacharya from Axis Bank. “Also to be noted are the RBI’s economic forecasts and assessment in the Monetary Policy Report of risk factors such as fiscal developments and the external conditions.”"

320,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 07:52 AM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,GSPL taking on debt to up stake in Gujarat Gas worries investors,"ET Intelligence Group : Investors in Gujarat State Petronet NSE 0.08 % (GSPL) should brace for a choppy ride in the short term after the gas transmission company bought an additional 28 per cent stake in listed fuel distributor Gujarat Gas NSE 0.50 % to help the common parent GSPC de-leverage its debtheavy balance sheet.

The stake purchase, at Rs 3,200 crore, raises GSPL’s holding in Gujarat Gas to about 54 per cent, making the latter a subsidiary of the acquirer. The GSPL stock has shed about 10 per cent in the past one month, primarily because the acquisition converts GSPL into a net-debt company from a net-cash entity. GSPL has Rs 700 crore of cash in its books and must raise Rs 2,500 crore more in debt to buy GSPC’s stake in Gujarat Gas.

Additional loans would increase GSPL’s debt to EBITDA ratio—a gauge of debt serviceability — beyond 2.3. Analysts liken the de-leveraging of GSPC to shifting the debt burden from the parent to the operating subsidiary.

At about 8.5 per cent a year, GSPL would have an incremental post-tax interest burden of about Rs 140 crore. Higher interest could lower projected earnings per share (EPS) in FY19 by 8-15 per cent. Transmission volumes for GSPL could also fall due to lower gas purchase by the refineries of as the latter’s pet-coke gasification units reach higher utilisation. The Street is pricing in gas transmission volumes of 24-25 mmscmd for FY19 from around 30.8 mmscmd in FY18.

Furthermore, the Street would now assign a holding company discount to the valuation of Gujarat Gas to compute the fair value of GSPL. Typically, the Street ascribes 20-30 per cent holding company discount to compute the fair value of a parent company. The lower valuation of the listed company to its current price due to the holding discount is called ‘valuation leakage’ in technical parlance.

This means the market is likely to consider the GSPL valuation based on Rs 664 per share for Gujarat Gas — translating into a 20 per cent discount to the current market price of the gas distributor - for computing the fair value of the acquirer. That could lower the price of GSPL by Rs 10-12 per share."

GSAT-6A was the second of the GSAT series satellites built by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) to provide high speed internet access on mobile devices for armed forces.

Isro lost contact with the satellite when it attempted to ignite its engine in a final move to its designated slot.

The satellite was launched on March 29. “If we don’t succeed to re-establish contact with the satellite, the mission is declared dead. An inquiry will attempt to find root cause of the snag. Also, there will be much more stringent quality checks now so that similar incidents doesn’t repeat,” an Isro scientist said. “This means there will be delay in building other satellites.”

Isro has lined up over 10 launches including GSAT-7A, remote sensing satellites Cartosat-3, Oceansat-3 and Chandrayaan-2, the moon mission with the space agency planning to land a rover on the earth’s satellite.

For Isro, this will be the second setback in seven months after a replacement satellite for Navic, the country’s navigation system failed in August to eject from the heat shield in space due to a snag.

An investigation found that a controlled explosive failed to detonate and break the latch that locked the satellite in the heat shield - the conical top portion of the rocket, and release the satellite into space."
322,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 01:14 PM IST",ET Bureau,Healthcare/Biotech,ChrysCapital set to acquire 10% in Mankind for $350 million,"ChrysCapital, along with limited partners GIC of Singapore and CPPIB of Canada, is set to write the largest private equity cheque in the Indian pharmaceutical space as it finalises a $350-million investment in Mankind Pharmaceuticals for a 10% stake, said people directly aware of the matter. If it goes ahead, this will value India’s fifth-largest drug maker at about $3.5 billion, they said.

The investment marks a return for ChrysCapital to Delhi-based Mankind after selling an 11% stake in 2015 to Capital International for $214 million for a tenfold return in seven years.

ChrysCapital’s late entry into the process even after binding bids were made by global buyout funds Advent and Carlyle for a 15% stake surprised many, but in the end the Indian fund trumped both. The final agreements are expected to be signed this week.

Investment bank Moelis & Co has been running a keenly contested formal process that had also seen interest from Warburg Pincus, General Atlantic and Apax Partners.



The Junejas, who started the company 25 years ago, favoured ChrysCapital over Advent, the other strong contender in the fray, due to its long association with the company and the sector, said people close to the family. ChrysCapital partner and former Ranbaxy executive Sanjiv Kaul is arguably the most successful pharma investor in the country, having backed companies as diverse as , Zydus, Intas, Torrent Pharma, GVK Bio, Eris Lifesciences and Ipca Labs.

The transaction is likely to include a secondary sale of shares by some of the promoter family members and even Capital, which may look at a partial exit, said the people cited above. The promoters own 89% of the company, which is poised to go public in the next financial year.

“This is a work in progress,” said Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma’s chief executive officer, in response to ET’s queries. ChrysCapital’s Kaul declined to comment.

With domestic sales of about ₹5,000 crore and FY18 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) expected at ₹1,000 crore, Mankind has been one of the fastest-growing drug companies in the past two decades. The owner of price-competitive, overthe-counter (OTC) brands like Kalori 1 sweetners or Manforce condoms, Unwanted 72 and Prega News, Mankind has also gone deep into smaller towns and villages with its prescription drugs. From the former countries, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan its global operations are now spread across 22 locations in Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia and the Arabian Gulf. Mankind Pharma, which has 18 manufacturing units at Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh, commissioned a new plant in Sikkim last year.

“Every year we are seeing at least a couple of pharma companies list in the public market successfully,” said Navneet Munot, who oversees the management of $30 billion in assets as chief investment officer of SBI Mutual Fund. “This is creating appetite for PE funds to back companies with strong product pipeline and healthy domestic market presence even at high valuations.”

Currently, 88% of Mankind’s revenue comes from its OTC portfolio and fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG) divisions, while the rest comes from the prescription and veterinary units. Even as India remains the priority market, the company has been exploring an entry into the US by filing its first set of documents this year with the to sell generic products. In India, it’s aiming to expand chronic therapies that already contribute around 20% of the top line.

“Mankind is the only company that stands to gain whichever way the new pharma policies move with respect to price controls or the push towards pure generics. They are unique in that sense,” said a PE investor focussed on the pharmaceutical and healthcare space.

Established in 1999, ChrysCapital has assets worth close to $3 billion under management across seven funds--and is set to launch its eighth—in more than 75 companies. It has already returned $4 billion to investors through more than 60 exits. It was among the founding investors of Yes Bank and one of the earliest spotters of tech and tech-enabled services such as Spectramind or non-banking finance companies such as Shriram Transport."

If the index manages to cross and sustain above the resistance zone of 10,200-10,250 on a consistent basis, then the strength of the relief rally towards 10,450-10,550 levels is expected to increase, according to technical analysts. They are bullish on Mahindra and Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp NSE 0.09 %, Eicher Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bata India NSE -0.06 % and HDFC Standard Life.

Where are We? The Nifty has recently formed a reversal candlestick after four weeks of consecutive decline and has bounced from the oversold levels. There are strong support clusters at 10,050-10,000 levels which are likely to provide cushion in case of declines. With emergence of positive divergence on the daily chart and bullish crossovers by the momentum indicators, expect a short-term trend reversal only on a decisive close above the 10,200 levels.

What is in Store? The Nifty faces immediate resistance at 10,200-10,230 levels on the upside; and on a decisive close above, expect a retracement rally towards the 10,450-10,550 levels. The Bank Nifty faces crucial hurdles around the 24,500 levels, which is a weekly resistance zone, and will need to close above the same for any bullish confirmation. The bank index has also tested its two years’ rising channel support line and one can take select contrarian trading bets for next few weeks. Maintain a bullish view on HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Bank of Baroda.

What could an Investor Do? We expect the auto sector to show relative outperformance in the coming few quarters as most of the stocks have tested long-term support levels zone and provides high margin of safety. Our top picks are Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero MotoCorp and Eicher Motors and expect 15-20 per cent returns. We are bullish on mid-cap IT stocks like NIIT and FSL which have formed a strong bullish support and indicate limited downside from the current levels and can expect 20-25 per cent return within 6-8 months.

The March 31 letter, which ET has seen, was sent days ahead of the April 2 deadline for submission of fresh bids for Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal and Numetal were the only two bidders in the earlier round but both offers were rejected because they didn’t conform to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The IBC bars promoters of defaulting companies or related parties and connected persons from bidding for assets unless they’ve paid their dues.

In Numetal’s case, the consortium includes a trust of which the beneficiary was a member of the Ruia family that promoted Essar Steel. In ArcelorMittal’s case, there were questions about its status as a co-promoter of Uttam Galva when it submitted its bid. ArcelorMittal said it exited Uttam Galva before submitting its bid and was therefore compliant.

The shareholders alleged that ArcelorMittal transferred its in Uttam Galva on February 7 without seeking the permission of lenders. “The transfer was in blatant disregard to their own undertaking to the banks,” they said.

ArcelorMittal rejected the allegations and said they were an attempt to stymie its bid for Essar Steel in partnership with Nippon Steel.

“We never had any management involvement, we had no board position and we have no shareholding in the company. The declassification was carried out in accordance with the processes of the stock exchanges,” it told ET. “It is nothing more than another tiresome and trivial attempt to muddy the waters and distract from the central fact that ArcelorMittal, together with our partner Nippon Steel, is the most credible owner of Essar Steel given our superior track record and standing in the industry,” the company added.

The five entities, including Numetal, ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, which submitted expressions of interest (EoIs) are eligible to participate in the second round of bids for Essar Steel.

ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV became a promoter of Uttam Galva in 2009 by acquiring shares in an open offer. The offer document stated that Arcelor Mittal had signed a co-promotion agreement with the existing promoters, the Miglani family, the shareholders said in the letter.

ArcelorMittal was disclosed as a promoter in all filings made by the company to Sebi, NSE, BSE and the ministry of corporate affairs, the letter said.

According to the minority shareholders, ArcelorMittal and other promoters signed a non-disposal undertaking while seeking a Rs 1,400 crore loan from a consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India in July 2011. Arcelor Mittal undertook to SBI that it would not “sell, transfer or dispose of” the shares held by it, according to this agreement, the letter said.

Further, the agreement — a copy of which was seen by ET— stated that ArcelorMittal undertook that, together with the other sponsors, it will sell its shares to the other sponsors only if no event of default had occurred. Further, Uttam Galva agreed that it would not register any transfer of the shares held by ArcelorMittal without the approval of SBI.

Apart from the chairman of SBI, the lead bank in the consortium, copies of the letters were also sent to the heads of Canara Bank, IDBI Bank, and Punjab National Bank.

“Bankers will duly exercise their rights if there is any violation of an agreement. As things stand now, we are examining the matter on the transaction between ArcelorMittal and Uttam Galva,” said a senior bank official who did not want to be named.

The shareholders alleged that the lenders of Uttam Galva, despite being aware of the transfer, didn’t collect their dues from ArcelorMittal or taken any action against it. They said there has been a “loss of Rs 6,000 crore of public money due to such inaction by banks.”

If Arcelor Mittal has the money to bid for Essar Steel, why is it not repaying Uttam Galva’s dues, the letter asked. The shareholders also questioned the speed with which NSE allowed the declassification of ArcelorMittal as a promoter of Uttam Galva."
327,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:03 AM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,Cut in H1 borrowing plan lowers duration risk for debt funds,"Mumbai: Debt mutual funds are adding more long-duration bonds to their portfolios after New Delhi last week promised to run a tight fiscal ship in the first half of FY19, seeking to rescue India’s bond market from its worst spell of sell-offs in about two decades.

“Overall, the borrowing plan has reduced the duration risk,” said Kumaresh Ramakrishnan, CIOFixed Income, DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund. “This in turn has prompted us to increase the average duration by two to three years. Even as the government tweaked its borrowing plan, additional demand will help bring down bond yields. The introduction of shorter maturity papers is also a key positive.”

Fund houses are now seen selling shorter maturity bonds only to buy longer dated securities amid an expected fall in the benchmark . Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Last week, North Block sought to revive India’s bond market after it unveiled an austere federal borrowing plan for the first six months of the financial year. Immediately after the announcement of the borrowing calendar with proportionate reductions, the bond yield fell 29 basis points last Tuesday, pushing prices up. It closed at 7.39 per cent Wednesday on a mild correction. Mumbai markets were shut on Thursday and Friday.

New Delhi last Monday said that its borrowings up to September would amount to about 48 per cent (excluding bond buybacks) of the overall target for the financial year. Normally, the government proposes to complete 60 per cent of the targeted borrowing in the six-month period to September.

“We have done some flattener trades that helped increase our average duration to an extent,” said Lakshmi Iyer, CIO-debt at Kotak Mutual Fund. “Given the government’s changed borrowing plan, there seems to be a lid on yields on the higher side. This, in turn, could enhance the returns on our bond funds.”

‘Flattener’ trades entail transactions in which a fund house replaces shorter-maturity holdings with longer-maturity papers.

For instance, Kotak MF has sold some 2022 maturity debt securities while buying 2028 maturity bonds.

“The revised borrowing calendar reflects the new realities of the market;” said Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Mutual Fund. “That demand for shorter end securities is likely to be higher going forward.”

“At the same time, the larger-thananticipated reduction in supply in the 10-year segment has likely prompted some tactical addition of duration,” he said.

The benchmark yield is likely to trade in the range of 7-7.30 per cent, moderating from the February highs of 7.77 per cent.

Maturities of less than ten years now account for a third of the debt, compared with 29 per cent being made up of 10-14 year securities. Bonds with one-four year maturities are 8.3 per cent of the whole borrowing size."

330,"Last Updated: Apr 04, 2018, 02:44 PM IST",ET Bureau,Energy,ReNew power buys Ostro in biggest renewables sector deal,"Sumant Sinha-led Re-New Power Ventures has finalised the takeover of Ostro Energy for an enterprise value of ₹10,800 crore ($1.66 billion), the biggest M&A deal in the renewables sector, sources close to the deal said.

The deal, part of the wave of consolidation in the rapidly-expanding sector, makes ReNew Power the largest renewable energy company in the country with total commissioned and under-construction assets of about 4,300 MW.

It is now well ahead of , which, with its ₹9,249 crore acquisition of ’s assets in June 2016, is in the second spot with total renewable assets of around 2,300 MW.

ReNew will pay around ₹4,500 crore as equity, while the remaining ₹6,300 crore will be the debt component. “ReNew believes these are excellent assets of a quality that few players in the country have,” said one of the sources. “Since most of them are operational, they also mitigate the risks associated with Greenfield projects.”

Neither ReNew Power nor Ostro Energy was willing to confirm the development.



Ostro Energy, set up in June 2014, has commissioned wind assets of 648 MW and another 350 MW are in the pipeline. It is also building around 110 MW of solar projects, making it a total of 1,108 MW across the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.

Ostro’s principal backer is the London-based private equity firm Actis, which invested $280 million in the company in early 2015. Actis invests exclusively in emerging markets and currently has interests across 21 countries. However, Actis has been looking for a profitable exit from Ostro for nearly a year now and had appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find a suitable buyer. Talks with Re-New Power have been on since last October-November.

ReNew Power, which has been planning an IPO for some months now, boasts a string of marquee investors including Goldman Sachs, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Global Environment Fund (GEF), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Japan’s JICA. JICA’s infusion of 10% stake in February 2017 valued the company at $2 billion.

While most of ReNew’s early projects started from scratch, it has lately been taking the inorganic route as well. In November, it bought the KC Thapar Group’s entire wind portfolio of 103 MW for around ₹1,000 crore.

The latest deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the renewable energy sector, which began with Tata Power’s buyout of Welspun Energy’s renewable assets.

Another major acquisition was ’ takeover of the Indian assets of US-based SunEdison for $392 million (₹2,500 crore) in October 2016, after the latter declared bankruptcy. Apart from ReNew’s acquisitions and Actis’s of Bhoruka, others include the Hero Group’s takeover of the wind portfolio of LNJ Bhilwara Group for an undisclosed sum in October last year and Vector Green Energy’s purchase of 190 MW solar assets from US-based First Solar for an undisclosed amount in July last year."

Aircel management has been closely working with Malaysiaheadquartered Maxis, owned by businessman T Ananda Krishnan, for the emergency infusion, the person told ET. Maxis is making the infusion through Mauritius-based subsidiary Global Communication Services Holdings (GCSH).

In a statement, GCSH said it has infused Rs 95 crore at March end to pay salaries and to meet some expenses for about a month-and-a-half till when the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) was appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal ().

Around 5,000 employees of Aircel, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the NCLT in February, have not been paid salaries since that month. Security personnel and contract staff, too, have not received their dues, raising safety concerns for the operator that is struggling to service a debt of over Rs 50,000 crore due to falling revenue and dwindling cash flows amid fierce competition.

Krishnan, who over the past 12 years had about $7 billion into Aircel without any returns, had decided to pull the plug on the telco, hamstrung by the brutal competition and legal woes that had stymied the company’s attempts at merging with Reliance Communications to survive.

Aircel’s quarterly operating profit of Rs 120 crore in July 2016, before Reliance Jio started services in September 2016, plunged to an operating loss of Rs 120 crore in December 2017. Aircel did not respond to ET's queries.

The Malaysian businessman’s latest dole out will be a near-term breather for the telco, which, under the bankruptcy process, is trying to find ways to get operations going again and repay its lenders. Experts say that while the amount is woefully inadequate, it at least is a sign that the management and the promoters are trying to take care of the carrier’s human resources which are key to its bid to restart operations.

ET had earlier reported that Iyer, in a letter, had assured employees that the company had initiated discussions with “an external party” to provide funds for salary dues. While admitting Aircel’s petition for bankruptcy protection, an NCLT bench had said it believed there was potential to revive the business, given the telco’s revenue generation and assets worth more than Rs 32,000 crore, including .

Besides NCLT, Aircel has been battling legal tussles with tower firms GTL Infrastructure and America Tower Company (), and vendors such as Swedish gear maker Ericsson over unpaid dues."
333,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 12:15 PM IST",ET Bureau,Healthcare/Biotech,Drug regulator plans national digital database of pharma manufacturers,"NEW DELHI: India's drug regulatory body is creating a national digital database of pharmaceutical manufacturers and their medicines so that regulators can be more effective when acting on problems like drug shortages and quality issues, people aware of the development told ET.

Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is finalising software for this and plans to amend rules for drugs and cosmetics to make it mandatory for manufacturers to regularly put details of their facilities and products in this database, they said.

The move is important to understand India's manufacturing capacity, improve inspections and law enforcement, and ensure patients get better medicines, experts said.

Currently, there is no comprehensive, real-time information on medicine makers in India and the central regulatory body relies on data from state authorities for specific queries, a person told ET on condition of anonymity. Often, states themselves are unaware of which drugs are manufactured in other states, another person said.

“Now, there is going to be a completely transparent system with proper data management,” said a senior government official, adding that the primary objective would be to get data on how many drug makers exist here.

The software will be ready and discussed during a meeting between centre and state drug regulators by the second week of April, the official said.

The new database would maintain names, addresses and licences of all manufacturers, therapeutic categories of their medicines and details like their dosages and forms, one of the sources said.


Once implemented, manufacturers will have to upload information of their existing facilities and medicines into the database within three months, after which state authorities would verify it through site visits.

Going forward, state regulators will update the database whenever they approve new drugs, the government official said.

The data will be used for various functions, including taking stock of manufacturers producing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), said the official. APIs are the key ingredients that give a drug its medicinal effects.

This would help improve response time during drug shortages due to reduction in API supply, according to a second official seeking anonymity. It could also help create better policies to promote the domestic industry, the person said.

The database may also be used to restrict manufacture or sale of specific medicines.

It will be a part of ‘SUGAM’, the e-governance portal of CDSCO. While an April 2017 notification shows the regulator already sought to create such a database, SUGAM still mostly deals with applications for licences from drug and vaccine makers, officials said.

The database is ""essential"" to promote better sharing of information between regulators in all states and the centre so that they can harmonise various activities, said quality by design cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) consultant Ranjit Barshikar. It will help in better planning of manufacturing site inspections and improve monitoring of product approvals, he told ET.


This would eliminate instances of different generic drugs being marketed with the same brand name. ""Patients will be safer. There will be better clarity amongst manufacturers and regulators,"" Barshikar said.

Dinesh Thakur, a public health activist who in 2013 exposed data manipulation issues at drug maker Ranbaxy, said, “Having updated information on manufacturers is a step in the right direction, but it is only one piece of the puzzle. Ultimately, the regulator needs to look at the overall picture, which is how the supply chain works in the country.”

CDSCO should also gather information on clearing and forwarding agents, retailers and pharmacies to better track the medicine's chain of custody, he said. This would help in instances like recalls of specific medicine batches due to quality concerns, Thakur said.

In 2007, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority had published a directory of pharma manufacturing units in India, but said the details did not purport to be an authentic version of these units."

Paytm has budgeted Rs 250 crore to promote money transfers and expects transactions under this to account for one-third of total transactions by the end of the year. The new look of the app went live for Apple iOS users on Sunday and will go live for Google Android users on Monday.



With the RBI’s new know-your-customer guidelines hurting digital wallet businesses, Paytm is seeking to promote bank-to-bank payments by making it seamless. It has so far separately offered money transfer options between its payment bank and other banks; payments bank account to payments bank account; bank account to bank account under UPI; and digital wallet to bank account, according to Paytm senior vice-president Deepak Abbot. Paytm is now positioning its app as a ‘super app’ for payments by offering multiple modes of payment under one option. The move is also likely a push from the company to enable large transactions such as rental payments through bank-to-bank transfers. While the company has so far focused mainly on peer-to-peer transactions on the digital wallet and peer-to-merchant transactions through QR codes, it is now also looking to capture large ticket-size use cases such as payments for house rent, to suppliers, and even for salaries of unorganized workforce. The instant money transfer will not be charged.

“Money transfer can often be a tedious process and we want to make it easy for people without having to log into their banking apps to send money,” said Paytm COO Kiran Vasireddy."

337,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:12 AM IST",ET Bureau,Transportation,Airfares to Dubai likely to soar next summer,"NEW DELHI: Indians planning a Dubai trip next summer may have to brace for a surge in fares as authorities in the emirate have asked Indian carriers to slash capacities by half due to a 45-day runway closure that will start April 16, 2019.

Flights by Indian carriers to Dubai account for about 65,000 seats per week. Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths has told them to cut this to half in a February 27 letter. Dubai airlines Emirates and flydubai have also been asked to make reductions.

“Dubai Airports will require Emirates and flydubai to reduce their total operations by approximately 33%,” according to the letter from Griffiths, seen by ET. “Passenger airlines (including Indian carriers) with multiple daily frequencies will be required to reduce their schedule by up to 50%.”

The letter, however, said that the 33% reduction by the two Dubai flag carriers would contribute 55% of the airport’s total cuts. But Indian carriers say the reductions aren’t equal and are discriminatory. They say India has been generous to Dubai with bilateral traffic rights.

“Why do we lay down the red carpet for Gulf carriers when we face step-brotherly treatment in their countries?” said an executive at an Indian carrier that operates flights to Dubai. He pointed out that when Delhi flights had to be cancelled due to an airport closure around the time of Republic Day, the Indian authorities had tried to ensure minimal disruption to the operations of international carriers.

Another airline executive said such treatment was not new and that Indian carriers had faced this during slot allocation, getting the least desired ones. The issue had been raised by the Indian authorities in 2016, when the then aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju had written to the Dubai civil aviation authority stressing non-availability of slots as the reason behind non-utilisation of bilateral entitlements by Indian carriers.

“The Indian carriers have informed that they are not being provided the desired slots at Dubai airport, and Dubai airport authority has been turning down requests of Indian carriers or providing options which are not viable for operations,” Raju had said in his letter.

The issue of discrimination in slot allocation was raised for the first time with the Dubai authorities during negotiations for an increase in bilateral flying rights between the two countries last year. The Indian authorities did not agree on an increase as Dubai authorities did not provide a commitment on desired slots for Indian carriers. Analysts said Dubai should have made an exception for Indian carriers."

Till financial year 2017-18, investors in equity-oriented mutual fund schemes who sold them after holding for more than a year paid zero LTCG. Balanced funds, equity savings funds and sectoral funds are also considered as equity-oriented funds as their net equity exposure is above 65 per cent. However, from financial year 2018-19, investors in all these categories of funds will have to pay a 10 per cent LTCG tax on gains made above Rs 1 lakh per annum.



The grandfathering clause is the exemption granted to existing investors for gains made by them before the new tax came into force. The government has done this to ensure that investors who have committed money keeping in mind the easier tax regime areprotected. As per the new laws, the government has said that gains made in equity-oriented mutual fund schemes till January 31, will be grandfathered or exempted. There will be no LTCG tax on notional profits on mutual funds till then.



Since this is a proposal it will be applicable for the assessment year 2019-20 (Financial Year 2018-19). In other words, long-term capital gains of over Rs 1 lakh made for the year 2018-19 will be taxed at 10 per cent.



For calculating LTCG, the following is the method: Purchase price is to be considered higher of (a) and (b). (the idea is that only gains made after Jan 31 are taxable)

a) Actual purchase price

b) Lower of ...

i) Fair market value (it is the highest price / market value as on January 31, 2018)

ii) Full value of consideration (it is the actual sale price). Next, for calculation of the final LTCG amount, exemption of Rs 1 lakh is applied. Thus if LTCG as per above is Rs 1,20,000 then 10 per cent on only Rs 20,000 = Rs 2,000 would be applicable.

.

Dividends on equity-oriented mutual funds are now taxed at 10 per cent. This provision had to come into effect since LTCG tax of 10 per cent has been levied. If dividends were not taxed, investors would have used it as a opportunity to switch to this option to avoid LTCG."

“There was a difference in opinion on how the organisation should be taken forward,” one of them said. “He wanted it more like a think tank and diversify it into other parts of the economy.” But the founders were “not so keen” on the idea.

Another person familiar with development said Badgaiyan was not comfortable turning the group into a lobby group serving only tech startups. “Gyan wanted Indiatech to emerge like an Ashoka University or an Indian School of Business, looking at the broader national interests which gives them a higher standing and that is how he came on board,” the person said. However, the founders wanted to “prioritise” their fight against Uber and Amazon and on some regulatory issues concerning the tech industry.

“He told them: ‘Look, I can’t head a lobby group for you and that is not my intention’,” he said. The person said Badgaiyan had put in his papers about three weeks ago and the founders of the lobby group finally accepted his resignation last week. He and two other sources said Badgaiyan now plans to start his own think tank. Badgaiyan did not respond to several phone calls and text messages sent on his mobile phone.

His exit leaves Indiatech in disarray, and not a single employee works for it at present. “There is not much action happening there now,” said a senior executive at atech firm that is part of the group.

Indiatech was born late last year after months of calls from Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal and Bhavish Aggarwal of Ola for protectionist support from the government against US internet giants such as Amazon and Uber. The high-profile founders had raised voices against foreign-origin rivals and they had urged the government to design policies which will favour home-grown internet companies. Aggarwal had accused overseas companies of using India as a “capital dumping ground”."

Sidbi holds 8.13 per cent in Bandhan Financial Services, the holding firm for Bandhan Bank, and held another 0.32 per cent in the bank itself before the bank’s share sale. Sidbi also holds 8.4 per cent in RGVN (North East) Microfinance among others.

“We are working on our investment strategy, which will cover treatment of our existing investments including Bandhan, strategy for future investments, and how to facilitate enhanced value to our existing shareholders,” Sidbi chairman Mohammad Mustafa told ET. “We will complete this in a couple of months.”

Sidbi also holds investment in MFIs through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sidbi Co. Sidbi has been associated with the MFI sector providing the lenders financial services ranging from loans, grant and equity.

“We continue to offer equity as also quasi-equity support to MFI ventures through the government’s India Microfinance Equity Fund scheme. Under the IMEF plan, the development bank provides Rs 1-3 crore quasi-equity support when MFIs are smaller in size and need equity to grow. Sidbi was set up in 1990 to meet the financial and developmental needs of the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector, which today contributes about 37 per cent to the nation’s . The MSME sector also contributes about 45 per cent to manufacturing output and about 40 per cent of exports in terms of value.

“While Sidbi started to intervene in both financial and non-financial space to help small-scale industries, it could not achieve the scale to make a difference,” Mustafa said. “We further realised that there are enough players in the market to extend finance while data related interventions can make a lot of difference. We at Sidbi have decided to focus on that,” he added.

There has been a significant rise in the new borrowers entering the formal credit market, which has accelerated to about 4 lakh at the end of December 2017 from about 2.7 lakh as on June 2016, indicating fresh investments being made.

Sidbi is also planning to gain currency in the MSME refinance market. “We are intervening in the digital space, we have created first successful online loan market place. We are also working to create an online loan sanction ecosystem. We are trying to re-imagine Sidbi,” the chairman said."
343,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:21 AM IST",ET Bureau,Energy,Companies begin selling BS-VI emission standard compliant fuel in Delhi,"Consumers need not pay more for higher grade fuel being sold across all petrol pumps in Delhi from Sunday nor should they immediately expect a dramatic drop in air pollution due to fuel switch.

Oil companies have begun selling Bharat Stage (BS)-VI emission standard compliant petrol and diesel at all 391 filling stations in Delhi, meeting the government-set deadline. Advancing deadlines for selling cleaner fuel is among several measures the government has taken in the last few years to curb the killer air pollution in the Capital.

State companies don’t plan to recover the incremental cost incurred in producing higher grade fuel from customers ‘immediately’ but may do so after April 2020 when the BS-VI petrol and diesel begin selling across the country, said B V Rama Gopal, Director (Refineries) of Corp, the country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer that controls nearly half of all filling stations in Delhi as well as the country.

Raising refineries’ capacity to produce has cost companies thousands of crores of rupees. Indian Oil, which is expecting a gross refining margin of $5-6 per barrel in the Jan-March quarter, is spending Rs 16,600 crore on its fuel upgradation plan, Gopal said. Compared to BS-IV fuel, which is currently sold across the country, producing and selling a litre of BS-VI fuel costs 50 paise more.

Using BS-VI fuel in vehicles that meet BS-IV or lower standards do not result in major emission reduction. Higher grade fuel in lower grade vehicles in Delhi could result in a reduction of particulate matter emission by 10-20%, Gopal said. Had fuel alone been the solution, automakers wouldn’t have had to upgrade their vehicles, Gopal said.

The plan is to expand the BS-VI fuel availability to the national capital region in a year and across the country by April 2020. “This was a big challenge. We have accepted the challenge,” said Gopal.

The oil companies are also working on meeting the latest instruction by the to make available BS-VI fuel to 13 metro cities besides the national capital region by April 2019. By April 2019 companies will be able to produce enough BS-VI fuel needed to serve 13 metros but are yet to figure out the logistics to ensure supply at relevant pumps, Gopal said.

Indian Oil’s refineries at Mathura and Panipat, Bharat Petroleum’s Bina refinery and ’s Bathinda unit are supplying the higher-grade fuel to Delhi outlets."

In an interview with ET, he said the company plans to make India a software development centre and participate in the country’s digital initiatives such as e-governance programme. Edited excerpts.

What are your plans for India?
Our revenue from India is $1.6 billion, not so big. Our main areas of business are construction machinery, IT services, automotive parts, and some industrial products. In the near future we would like to accelerate digital solutions. We are very interested in digital India and e-governance concept; and we would like to introduce Hitachi’s to enhance e-governance. We are very much interested in this. GDP growth of India is now about 7%; Hitachi revenue is going up more than 15%. We would like to emphasise on the digital field much more. I believe India is a very significant market for Hitachi. If he plans India strategy, I’m always open. He (Hitachi India MD Bharat Kaushal) is a key person for me.


Our revenue growth is already more than 15%. We are considering organic growth. We will double our revenue by 2021. This is organic growth. It depends on business condition, but if the digital business does well, we have to go for much more, including mergers and acquisitions.


We plan to open a Lumada Centre (Internetof-Things platform) here. There are many management concerns like quality problem, how to minimise lead time, improve transportation, e-commerce, value chain. If there are some such management issues, we’d like to share the issues, visualise the issue and implement in the Lumada platform.


Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken about ‘make in India, sell to the world’. There is talk about an Asia-Africa growth corridor. We can produce here in India to sell to Africa. In the power sector, I’m very much interested in solar panel products and sell to Africa. We already have a factory in Ahmedabad to make UPS, inverters. It’s very good if we can expand business in Africa.


I don’t care just about the panel. Take for instance, Neemrana industrial park, we introduced some solution. That’s not just the solar panel, but also generator, hybrid type. We can estimate tomorrow’s solar generation, what kind of schedule, backup generation. We can provide Energy management system. I don’t care about the panel itself. The other interesting technology, if we establish a large solar panel, it is very difficult to find defect. Hitachi is not a panel provider. It’s a total system provider.


It is not only India. Almost all Asian countries consider Hitachi as a home electric company. Hitachi is no more a home electric provider, but also a solution provider. So we changed the name. Social innovation business. We can provide high value to railway system, water treatment system and energy system.


IT and construction machinery is a very good portion of that. Revenue of these two will go up. For the digital side, it’s very important we align with the Indian government. So we should stress on e-governance. Once we provide solution to India, we’d like to sell to Africa.


I mentioned the Lumada Centre here. We can develop solutions such as solar panel energy management system. If African people need these kind of solar panels, we can provide there. Water treatment. Hitachi has a unique technology. Other desalination plants consume a lot of energy. We can use our pipeline management. Reduce saline content instead of RO, we can save a lot of energy. If somebody is interested in this system, we’d like to introduce here and sell these kind of things to Africa with a partner. We already have such kind of experience in Japan.


We are looking at the Middle East and Africa.


I think so. Decision-making process is very quick now, after Modi. After 2014, there is an acceleration. I feel a lot is changing.


Hitachi has 27 group companies in India. Our workforce is 10,000. Half of them, 5,000, are IT solution people —they will almost double by 2021.


I mentioned the Lumada is a global ecosystem. Two categories. One is the development of a common platform for global use; other one is customisation in India. I think India is a very, very good place, suitable place to develop such a platform and customise. India will become a software developing centre. I expect such kind of development."

350,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:38 AM IST",ET Bureau,Expert Views,"Expect earnings growth to touch 20%-plus in FY19, too: Saion Mukherjee, Nomura","Volatility can intensify in the coming months due to political uncertainties but the long-term view on Indian equities remains positive, says Saion Mukherjee, head of India equity research at Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities (India). Mukherjee says his optimism stems from the “very likely” scenario of a 20% plus earnings growth in FY19, which will sustain well into the next year. He tells Sanam Mirchandani why he is bullish on auto and gas stocks but not so upbeat on IT.

Edited excerpts:

Are markets more reasonably valued after the sharp correction from all-time highs?

We have a target of 11,380 on the Nifty for December 2018, based on 16 times one-year forward earnings. The correction does make the market little more attractive. From a three-year perspective, this can really be a great opportunity to invest because what we firmly believe is that earnings growth will come back.

Foreign investors still like India from a long-term perspective. Structurally, we are constructive on equities. But in the near term, six months or one year of underperformance can’t be ruled out.

The reintroduction of LTCG tax makes the attractiveness of this asset class somewhat lower. Volatility can intensify towards the second half of this year with uncertainties around politics and . From a sentiment perspective, this is something which can have an impact on the markets.



US trade deficit with India is much lower compared to other countries like China. To that extent, we can say that the impact will be lower. However, the developments are concerning and India may get adversely impacted, particularly some sectors like pharmaceuticals and textiles.

US has a high trade deficit with India and any measures towards these sectors will be negative. India provides export subsidies and the US has raised this issue with the World Trade Organization.



In the next two quarters, the base effects will remain quite strong. In fact, it can get stronger. We expect that the reported earnings growth can be materially good. For FY19 also, we are expecting 20% plus earnings growth.

The corporate earnings to GDP ratio is quite low and that is likely to get back to a more reasonable level. FY19 could be slightly better because of the favourable base effect but as we go into FY20 also, a lot of this momentum would sustain. Historically, we have seen that there is a very strong inverse co-relation between the corporate earnings to GDP and the next five years earnings CAGR. If I take a 3-5 year view, earnings trajectory should be stronger than what we have seen in the recent past. We will not be surprised if we continue to see 15-20% kind of an earnings growth on a sustained basis.



There has been disappointment versus earnings expectations for almost five years. Even the December quarter earnings were 4% lower than what we had anticipated. From a top-down picture, earnings are really suppressed. On a bottom-up basis, if you aggregate individual analyst expectations, it is suggesting a very strong revival.

If I take a two-year picture, from FY18 to FY20, we are talking about a 48% increase. Therefore, 20% plus earnings growth is very likely in FY19 and for FY20 we expect slightly lesser growth because the base is not as favourable but it is still going to be somewhere in the mid-teens.



On the macro side, things have gotten worse. It is a tussle between improving micro and the challenging macro and the question is which part will dominate. The macro has turned somewhat more adverse than what we thought. The fiscal push by the US government makes us concerned on .

Domestically also, there has been somewhat of a negative from a macro perspective. The Budget indicated a fiscal slippage. There has been an introduction of long-term capital gains tax on equities, which increases the cost of capital for equities. In the recent past, there have been issues in the banking system, primarily the scam, which raises fundamental questions on the banking system. If it remains within control, things will be ok. On a bottom-up basis, we think there are still interesting stories or interesting stocks that one can look at.



One has to go with good quality companies at reasonable valuations and where there is a long-term structural story in place.

The auto sector comes in that category. There are stocks in the auto sector which are not necessarily cheap but there is a structural story. Valuations are expensive versus history but it is still within the comfort zone. One can look at both four wheeler and two-wheeler companies, and even auto ancillaries. We see value in gas companies.



Consumer staples is one sector which is very expensive and so we avoid it. We are overweight private banks versus public sector banks and prefer retail banks over corporate banks. We are underweight on IT services also. In a volatile market, IT index has done better this year but growth is likely to be in single digits.



We have been overweight on healthcare but it is more of a micro story. Each company is at different point of cycle. Some companies are getting into problems. Some companies are expected to come out of their problems. The issues in the sector are largely to do with the US market and the correction in the stocks has taken away a lot of the excesses from the expectations. At the margin, the risk reward has definitely started to become favourable."

First-choice point fielder. Once upon a time opening batter. Most times opening bowler. Almost Test centurion. Part-time lawyer. Cancer-awareness advocate. And world’s No. 1 ODI bowler.

Most human beings would be happy with being just one or two of these. But simply by being herself, Jessica Jonassen ticks all of the above boxes. “It’s part of who I am,” Jonassen told Economic Times a day before she helped Australia claim their first T20I series win since 2015.

They did it in style too, putting up a world-record 209 in the first innings, eventually beating England by 57 runs.

Jonassen, who bowls left-arm spin, had an economy of 7.5 despite bowling in the powerplay in many of the games in the series. In the preceding ODIs against India she was outstanding, topping the wicket charts with eight scalps, three clear of her competition. For perspective, Jonassen had more wickets than all of India’s frontline spinners put together. Known simply as Jess or JJ, her bowling has shown clear plans for both formats.

“It’s about building pressure, wickets will come after that. It’s important that you’re not searching for those wickets too hard,” she said. But how do bowlers pick themselves up in a batter’s game, where the new playing conditions making it more challenging for them?

“It’s about building pressure, wickets will come after that. It’s important that you’re not searching for those wickets too hard,” she said. But how do bowlers pick themselves up in a batter’s game, where the new playing conditions making it more challenging for them?

“You almost have to take the ego out of it a little bit. As a bowler you generally don’t like going for runs, but on a field like this (Brabourne stadium, where the matches were played) you have to expect that and not go into your shell too much. It’s almost expected that even your good balls are going to go for boundaries,” Jonassen said.

The statement of self-identity at the beginning of this article has little to do with her considerable cricketing prowess though. It was about Jonassen being in a same-sex relationship. “I’m not going to hide that,” she said.

In February, she got engaged to her partner, and her Instagram feed features a number of photos of the happy couple. But six months ago, Australian laws did not recognise their right to marry.

A November 2017 plebiscite changed that, with a postal vote giving the YES camp a 61.6 per cent majority. Jonassen’s Twitter banner image sports a large rainbow heart next to an equally colourful YES. Cricket Australia too threw their support behind the YES vote, as did more than 30 other sporting organisations.

“I guess I’m fortunate enough to live in Australia that’s recently passed marriage equality,” she shared. “And I feel for (the) people who are in same sex relationships in countries where it’s not supported.”

One of those countries is India, where Jonassen has spent the last three weeks. Far from same-sex marriages being discussed, homosexuality is still criminialised by law and a taboo at most dinner tables, and homophobic attacks are not unheard of. But despite the raised profiles of female cricketers meaning that she might be recognised on the street, Jonassen is not afraid of any backlash.

“I don’t feel unsafe in the slightest over here.” Her first line of defence is being comfortable with who she is. Her second? Cricket. “Over here, if you’re involved in cricket everybody almost bows down to you! It’s a pretty amazing place to be.”

And yet she is aware of the change that her visibility can create. “I guess we’re in a fortunate position to have some influence over the public. Hopefully we can have positive influence in a number of areas, not just in our on field performances, but who we are as people as well.”

Bravery, the right amount of ego, and honesty are good qualities to have on the cricket field. Add that to Jonassen’s skill with the ball, and you have someone who is much more than the sum of her parts."

As it is with most places of reverential significance, the Augusta National Golf Club is tucked away in a quiet corner. Augusta, a central eastern town of Georgia, sits on the banks of the Savannah.

A pilgrimage to the estate, down the famed Magnolia Lane, is an essential journey in the evolution of a golfer. Augusta is a temple where time stands still. And it is where golf goes each year, for a uniquely poignant spring festival amidst a timeless setting of subtle serenity.

The Green Jacket is a status symbol unlike any in the game of golf. Especially so when you earn it on a spring Sunday by outplaying the very best men in the game. It is an exclusive, invited field — only the top 50 men in the ranking order, PGA Tour winners of the current season, past Masters champions, earned exemptions, a handful of amateurs and special invitees make up an elite field.

There will be just 87 men this year, the smallest field since 1997. One of them is a rising Indian star, languishing at 521st in the world just a few months ago. Since then he has stormed into the global spotlight — with two wins on the European Tour and a rousing performance in the WGC Mexico Championship. This week, he will become the eighth Indian to play a major.

Along the way, Shubhankar Sharma soared from his lowly November ranking to 68 in the world now. He will ride through Magnolia Lane on a special invitation from the Masters. At the only constant major venue in golf, that must feel like being wide awake in the thick of your wildest dream.

He will have two practice rounds and the familial par-3 contest to allow dream and reality to dissolve into one. On Thursday, Shubhankar will become just the fourth Indian golfer — Jeev Milka Singh (3 apperances), Arjun Atwal (1) and Anirban Lahiri (2) being the others — to experience the joy of playing in this event.

And there is heightened interest in the 82nd edition of the Masters. The return of Tiger Woods, his legion of fans aroused by a run of 10 rounds of par or better, is sending expectations northward. Woods has been installed odds-on favourite (10-1) along with Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas.

“I’ve been better with each week I’ve One for the Masters competed,” said Woods in a statement on his website. “A little more crisp. I’m starting to put the pieces together. “I’m just really looking forward to playing. It’s the best run tournament in the world. The golf course, the patrons, the entire atmosphere. It’s a golfer’s heaven.”

Phil Mickelson, three-time winner in Augusta, is back in the frame. His victory in the WGC event in Mexico ended a drought that stretched back to the Phoenix Open in 2013.

While Thomas has been the runaway player on form this season, Bubba Watson has thrown his hat in the ring with an impressive victory in the WGC Dell Match Play. The fact that he vanquished Thomas on his way to the finals should do his confidence a world of good.

Sergio Garcia is a liberated man, ever since he first adorned the Green Jacket. His love for life has grown deeper since then. Golf channel reporter, Angela Akins and Garcia turned parents this March, with the arrival of a beautiful little girl.

The joyous parents named the girl Azalea, after the flowers that decorate Augusta and the 13th hole at which Garcia made his poignant move towards victory in 2017. An encore might take some doing though, only three men have succeeded in defending the Masters since its inaugural edition in 1934 — Jack Nicklaus in 1966, Nick Faldo in 1990 and Woods in 2002, a club that seems nearly as hallowed as the Masters itself.

McIlroy’s journey to Augusta is never short on ambition or angst. The young man is already a four-time major winner, needing just the Green Jacket to complete his collection of majors. He will back in Augusta for a tenth time, to quench his thirst for a career grand slam.

But McIlroy is far from a lone warrior. After all, this is where golfers of all hues assemble each year to taste the elixir of its soul.

358,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 02:51 PM IST",ET Bureau,Startups,"Experts strike a discordant note on Saavn, Jio $1-b deal","BENGALURU| MUMBAI: India’s largest company Reliance Industries set the country’s digital sector aflutter late last month, by announcing that its music streaming unit would merge with Saavn India, creating a new entity deemed to be worth $1 billion.

JioMusic, housed within Reliance’s telecom arm, was valued at nearly twice the estimated worth of Saavn, according to the terms of the deal.

In a market notoriously tough to monetise, not only in India but also in developed markets like the US and China, the valuation of the merged entity has left investment bankers and analysts, who track the sector, surprised.
As per the terms of the deal, Reliance Industries has invested $124 million into Saavn at a pre-money valuation of $177 million, a 40-50% discount to the last round valuation, when Saavn raised $100 million in 2015. Th is pegs the post-money valuation of the entity at $301 million. Of the $124 million investment, $104 million is to be paid to existing investors via a buyback, according to sources, and $20 million infused into the company for operations.
Reliance is also transferring JioMusic business, housed under an entity called Reliance Digital Services, to Saavn India through “a slump sale”, valuing JioMusic at $670 million. Therefore, the merged entity is valued at $970 million, with Reliance committing to invest another $80 million into the venture . In this structure, Reliance has declared its own music unit to be a unicorn with a valuation of $1 billion, setting a benchmark for a potential external round of funding in the near future, said two investment bankers. Saavn’s investors will get $104 million in cash, less than what they invested in the company, along with residual equity holding in an entity 81% owned by Reliance.
Saavn India, founded by Rishi Malhotra, Vinodh Bhat and Paramdeep Singh in 2007, is backed by investors like and .

Experts said it was unclear as to why JioMusic, with revenues that are a fraction of Saavn, has been deemed to be worth nearly 4x the premoney value of the venturefunded company. Typically, the value of privately held internet companies is based on their market share of usage or of revenues, as well as future prospects on market share and market size.

According to analysts, metrics such as number of active users and engagements have been used for JioMusic valuation. But a few of them also point out that the ‘installs’ of the JioMusic app, because of the JioPhone, are disproportionately more than its usage. RIL and Saavn did not respond to email queries sent by ET, including requests to share user metrics.
Jio has been investing in a number of content players like and , and experts tracking the space said the company’s strategy is to drive monetisation through more data consumption. Investments like Saavn is a part of Jio’s user acquisition strategy in a bundled offering. So far, JioMusic is only available to Jio subscribers.
“Jio’s strategy is to build an ecosystem that gives people a reason to consume copious amounts of data, which is the revenue driver. Saavn being an independent service earlier and now part of a larger media house, they individually have a huge library of music and the combined entity will definitely be a significant player in the market but I would not necessarily say dominating the market,” said Jehil Thakker, partner at Deloitte. Going forward, the battle for leadership in the music streaming market will be fought between three local players-JioMusic-Saavn, Times Internet’s Gaana, which recently raised $115 million last month from Tencent, China’s largest internet company, and Bharti’s - besides global players such as Apple Music, and Google Play Music. Times Internet is part of BCCL, which publishes The Economic Times.
Analysts foresee a few challenges for the Jio-Saavn combine in the future. A large portion of Saavn’s revenues come from outside India. As far as the battle for the Indian market is concerned, Gaana’s revenues are more than Saavn’s in the local market. Moreover, like Bharti’s Wynk, which is being bundled for free with Airtel, Jio-Saavn will be a free service as well. This will add to Jio’s costs. Experts tracking the space said that Apple and Google are unlikely to aggressively push their music products as it is a part of their operating systems. Both Airtel and Reliance have been able to gather a larger user base for Wynk and Jio, respectively, because they are either pre-installed or are subsidised heavily as a part of the marketing strategy.
“In terms of market share, you would presume that about 60-70% is Gaana and Saavn dominated, with both of them having almost an equal share. Gaana would comparatively have a slightly larger subscriber base and the rest would come into the remaining 30-40%,” said an analyst tracking the space. “Definitely see the main four surviving - Jio-Saavn, Gaana, Wynk and Amazon Prime Music. As long as they keep driving data consumption, there is no pressure for them to show profits and losses.”"

360,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 11:11 PM IST",ET Bureau,Banking/Finance,Reconsider Shikha Sharma’s 4th term: RBI to Axis Board,"The Reserve Bank of India has asked the Axis Bank board to reconsider the fourth three-year term it gave CEO Shikha Sharma last year, said several people aware of the development. They said it could presage a tightening of scrutiny on the appointment of bank CEOs by the regulator.

The regulator addressed the letter to Axis Bank chairman Sanjiv Misra and gave its reasons for urging a review, said the people cited above. These included the bank’s performance and its deteriorating asset quality, they said, adding that the board is now considering a oneyear term for Sharma, during which it will look for a successor.

Sharma, who took charge in 2009, is in her third term as the bank chief, with the fourth set to begin in June. did not reply to ET’s queries.

Axis Bank said communications between the bank and the regulator are confidential. “The bank’s board follows a standard process on senior appointments, and forwards its recommendations to the regulator. This process is currently in progress and we are unaware of any final decision on this issue.

We would also like to mention that the correspondence between the regulator and the bank is strictly private and confidential,” the spokesperson said. “We have no further comments to offer as the queries raised are speculative.”



The move comes as another private sector lender’s CEO is beset by allegations that her relatives may have benefited from loans given to them by one of the bank’s borrowers. Axis Bank has seen a spurt in non-performing assets (NPAs) by 336% in the past three years. The bank, which reported gross NPAs of Rs 1,173 crore at end of December 2009, saw them jump to Rs 25,001crore at end of December 2017.

Gross NPA ratio, which was at 1.23% in December 2010, is now at 5.28%.

The bank flourished under Sharma’s leadership until things took a turn for the worse after RBI announced its asset quality review in December 2015. At end of December 2016, gross bad loans were at Rs 20,466 crore against Rs 5,724 crore at end of December 2015.

Net profit fell to Rs 579 crore in the December 2016 quarter from Rs 2,175 crore in the year earlier. It stood at Rs 726 crore in the December 2017 quarter. There had been speculation about her departure in June last year amid reports that the Axis Bank board had hired executive search firm Egon Zehnder to look for a CEO. But after talk that she was considering job offers from Tata, Piramal and Bajaj groups, the board announced a fourth three-year term for Sharma till June 2021 in July, a year before the third one was to end.

In the past year and a half, the bank has been penalised by RBI for incorrectly reporting bad loans. The asset-class divergence uncovered by RBI was Rs 9,480 crore in FY16 andRs 5,633 crore in FY17. Laden with infrastructure loans, it has struggled to contain nonperforming assets and projections to analysts have missed their mark. Other lenders have also been penalised for this.

Sharma had told ET in October last year that such setbacks were bound to happen.

“When you lead a large organisation and things go well, you get bouquets. If things don’t go well, you get brickbats,” she said at the time. “As an institution, we are trying to be as transparent as we can.

Some things went well, some didn’t go well, and we kept responding on the fly. Our belief is we were certainly not an outlier. This too shall pass.”

She said the bank had been forced to deal with issues outside its control. “We have tried to put as many disclosures, but you can’t blame anybody. Because ultimately as a bank, we are dealing with a bulky corporate book,” she said.

The adverse developments have led investors to question the ability of management and auditors to properly assess stress in the portfolio, said the people cited above.

From its peak of Rs 618 in February 2015, the Axis Bank share is down almost 20% till date.

During the same period, the Nifty has been up nearly 15%.

In February last year, Sharma had refuted talk of a potential merger of Axis Bank with Kotak Mahindra Bank. She also led a $1.8 billion capital-raising exercise with global private equity major Bain in November last year that was the largest private equity transaction in India. Some analysts said however that the money may have to go toward provisioning requirements rather than fuelling growth."

Having gapped down on the last trading day of the truncated week, the Nifty is placed at a crucial juncture where the probability of range expansion has increased significantly. The index tested 9,950-9,980 in March which could act as swing supports for now, while 10,200-10,250 zones, where slew of short-term moving averages are placed, may be termed as near-term resistance.

What is in Store?
The index has ended in red for two consecutive derivatives series, with a loss of 2.59 per cent for March series. Since 2009, whenever the index has posted negative returns for two consecutive derivative expiries, it has followed by a positive expiry. However, there is an exception to this in Feb 2015, March 2015 and April 2015, where the losses have extended for three series. Even the FII derivative activity data show they are at the lowest levels on index longs over last six years, if the above said themes play out in the April series, we may expect recovery in the markets if there is no major negative news flow. If the index keeps getting sold on every rise, then selling pressure would eventually drag it back to the support zone or even lower.

373,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 09:16 AM IST",ET Bureau,Commodities,Indians hold on to gold expecting a price rise,"Kolkata: Indians have not parted with their household gold in the first quarter of the calendar year despite gold appreciating by 4.41 per cent. Old gold sales in the first quarter have dropped by 35-40 per cent compared to the previous quarter.

Analysts and traders feel that people are holding back yellow metal in anticipation that prices may climb further in the coming months if the tariff war between US and China intensifies.

“Also, if geo-political tensions between US and North Korea escalate, it too will have an impact on gold. In the first quarter of 2018, old gold sales have come down by 35-40 per cent,” said James Jose, secretary, Association of Gold Refineries and Mints. It is said that nearly 22,000 tonnes of gold are lying idle in Indian households.

on January 1 of this year was Rs 29,525 per 10 gm which went up to touch Rs 30,830 per 10 gm last week.

“Uncertainty has gone up following the trade war between the US and China, resulting in gold prices climbing,” said Sekhar Bhandari, business head for global transaction (banking and precious metals) at Kotak Mahindra Bank. “The yellow metal can become a safe haven again.”

Prices are expected to remain firm in the April-June quarter, and may even touch $1,380-$1,400 a troy ounce, Bhandari said.

Surendra Mehta, national secretary of Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), is optimistic that gold prices may touch Rs 33,000 per 10 gm in the coming months.

2017 was not an eventful year for gold.

Although prices went up by 11 per cent for a day or two, the returns for the entire year was around 6 per cent -7 per cent. In contrast, equities gave much higher returns to investors which took away the sheen from gold. In fact, in the last quarter of calendar 2017, return from gold prices was around 1 per cent. “There was selling pressure on gold in the last quarter as investors were getting out of the yellow metal and parking funds in equities. The scenario changed over the last few weeks after US-China tariff war kicked off,” said a bullion dealer.

Jose added that activity in gold might return around Akshaya Tritiya which falls on April 18 this year. Indians purchase gold on Akshaya Tritiya as they consider that purchasing the precious metal on this auspicious day can bring prosperity. “Around Akshaya Tritiya, we expect people to exchange old gold and buy something new. In fact, jewellery sales have also plummeted in the first quarter along with old gold sales,” said Saurabh Gadgil of Pune-based PNG Jewellers."

The deal, an official announcement of which is expected as early as on Monday, will be the US insurance and financial services giant’s eighth acquisition in India in 12 months, as technology-enabled financial services businesses in the country continue to attract strategic investors.

“Ebix will take over the entire business of Centrum including its staff. The deal has been signed and an official announcement is due on Monday,” one of the sources told ET.

After the deal, Centrum is expected to focus mainly on its lending operations, as the company is making aggressive expansion of its NBFC business since ex-Standard Chartered banker Jaspal Bindra joined it as chairman in April 2016.

Centrum called the news “market speculation” and declined to comment further. “I am not aware of any such agreement being signed till date,” Ebix chief executive Robin Raina said in an emailed response to ET’s query.

The transaction will provide an exit to Jacob Ballas Capital, which invested close to $50 million for about a 30 per cent stake in the company last year.

Centrum Direct deals in foreign exchange services such as currencies, overseas remittances, prepaid travel cards and traveller’s cheques. It services over 1 million forex transactions annually and is present in 46 cities. The company is the largest airport forex provider in India, with services at 23 airports.

This sale will provide Centrum with a large resource base to grow its lending businesses of housing finance, SME and microfinance, as well as pursue inorganic growth opportunities. In November 2017, Centrum had acquired the microfinance portfolio of FirstRand Bank India.

Centrum is also a well-established player in , wealth management, institutional broking and Insurance distribution.

Atlanta-based Ebix is an international supplier of on-demand infrastructure exchanges to the insurance, financial, and healthcare industries. The company has made seven acquisitions in the past one year as it aims aggressively to get into the digital financing space and technology-enabled financial services businesses in the country. In May last year, Ebix acquired Itzcash from a group of investors including the Essel group for about $125 million.

The company started consolidating the remittance space by acquiring in August for around $7 million. It then bought YouFirst Money Express, another remittance entity, for an undisclosed amount. The company has segregated a $100 million kitty for consolidation in the payments space and setting up of a financial exchange in India.

It has more than 50 office across Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore, the US and the UK. Ebix powers multiple exchanges across the world in the fields of life, finance, health and property and casualty insurance while conducting in excess of $100 billion in insurance premiums annually on its platforms, its website showed."

Petrol prices are now hovering over four-year peak in the country and diesel is at an all-time high following a rapid rise in international rates led by strong global demand.

The prices of non-branded petrol was raised by 10-11 paise per litre in different metro cities today while diesel prices were increased by 11-12 paise.
Petrol prices were highest since September 2013 in Delhi. In Mumbai and Chennai, prices were highest since July 2014, and in Kolkata since August 2014. Petrol was sold for Rs 73.83 a litre in Delhi, and Rs 81.69 in Mumbai at Indian Oil pumps.



Diesel was also selling at record prices in all four metro cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. At Indian Oil outlets, diesel was priced at Rs 64.69 a litre in Delhi and Rs 68.89 a litre in Mumbai.

Higher prices are considered negative for heavy oil importers like . Higher fuel prices trigger broader inflation, shrink room for rate cuts by the central bank, increase demand for foreign exchange, and leave the exchequer with lesser resources for development work as demand for subsidy and tax cuts rises.

A sharp recovery in crude oil prices, which is up 47% since July 1 last year, is estimated to have expanded India’s oil import bill to $88 billion in 2017-18 from $70 billion in the previous year. India imports nearly 82% of its oil requirement.

Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum control about 92% of fuel market while private players such as Reliance, Essar and Shell control the balance.

On Sunday, state companies cut prices of jet fuel in their monthly revision. Indian Oil cut the price to Rs 61,450 per kilo litre from Rs 61,681 for domestic airlines.

Petrol and diesel prices are market determined in India for years. To arrive at retail prices, companies add their marketing margin, dealers’ commission and government duties to refinery gate prices that are equal to international rates of petrol and diesel.

Crude oil, which collapsed in mid-2014 and has since traded lower, has sharply gained in the past nine months. It’s up 47% since July 1 last year, and has gained about 5% this year.

Strong compliance on supply cuts promise by key producers including OPEC members and Russia, and talks about some producers considering extending efforts at draining the global supply glut to next year seem to be pushing up oil prices."

The operational creditors, who have formed a common platform — Binani Operational Creditors Forum (BOCF) — alleged that Dalmia Bharat was attempting to “sabotage” the settlement as suggested by the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal. Dalmia Bharat is one of the bidders for Binani Cement under a court-monitored process to settle its debt crisis.

The last week suggested that the committee of creditors (CoC) could look at settling the debt issue with Binani out of court as requested by the cement major. ""When CoC planned a meeting last Thursday, Dalmia Bharat had protested against the move and tried to scuttle it,"" said Hitesh Bindal, a BOCF spokesperson. The CoC meeting, sources said, was abruptly called off.

“In the entire process, it is the operational creditors’ interest that is being ignored as Dalmia Bharat has not made any concrete offer to us,” Bindal added.

Binani, in its affidavit to the NCLT, has offered to settle 100% dues including those of operational creditors by April 10, he said and suggested that the CoC should actively consider this and ignore the Dalmia protest. “We do not understand as to what is Dalmias’ problem if every creditor gets his dues,” Bindal argued.

The first fruit of the bankruptcy law could have been available following an out-of-court settlement, he said, and pointed out that the Dalmias threw a spanner in the works and, “we are at loggerheads”.

The operational creditors had earlier filed an intervention petition at the NCLT questioning the way the resolution professional (RP) was conducting the settlement process without hearing their case. The RP appeared to be interested only in financial creditors’ claims and not that of the OCs, the petition said.

The OCs had played a major role in bringing Binani to an ongoing concern stage from its bankruptcy which cannot be ignored by anyone, the BOCF said. “Our claims are legitimate and we just want them and nothing more,” the spokesperson said.

The OCs petition alleged that the RP was being partisan as he did not heed to their pleas to involve them in the settlement process.

With the NCLT is scheduled to take up the petition for hearing on Monday, the BOCF said it would plead for clear-cut directives from the tribunal to take the OCs claims as well."
386,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 09:41 AM IST",ET Bureau,Commodities,Trade war worries diamond industry,"Kolkata : Escalation in the USChina trade war is emerging as a major concern for India’s diamond trade.

The US, a major buyer of gems and jewellery from India and China, levies a 6 per cent duty on imports. While this has not been altered, the Trump administration’s decision to increase the tax on commodities like steel and aluminium has made global markets nervous. If Donald Trump decides to increase the duty on items such as gems and jewellery to check shipments from China, it will hurt India as well.

Any such decision would be a double whammy for the sector, where the Rs 13,600-crore Punjab National Bank scam involving diamond merchant Nirav Modi has already resulted in slowing down of bank finance. Gems and jewellery exporters do not expect any growth in fiscal 2019, as it will be hard to get bank finance.

“Though the US has not done anything with the gems and jewellery sector as of now, the escalation of trade war between the US and China has generated a bit of nervousness in all sectors including gems and jewellery,” Praveen Shankar Pandya, a former chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), told ET. “Everybody is keeping a close watch on the global economic developments. The US being our major exporting nation, any policy change will affect our trade.”

Diamond exporter Vipul Shah said: “Anything can happen anytime. It is a matter of concern to Indian exporters, including gems and jewellery exporters. After all, India is trade surplus with the US.”

Pandya said what was more disturbing to the sector was bank finance. “If finance is curtailed, then the trade cannot grow. From April it is expected that banks will tighten finance to the sector and will ask for more collaterals. That will have an impact on the sector which is a major foreign exchange earner for the country. Exports in FY19 will be at par with FY18 with no growth if this situation continues,” he said.

In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, exports were down 9.15 per cent in rupee terms from a year earlier.



Diamond trade analyst Anirudha Lidbide said: “Most of the banks in Antwerp (the global diamond hub), like ABN Amro, Antwerp Diamond Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, are either getting out of diamond trade or reducing their exposure to the sector. Post the Nirav Modi scam, it is expected that public sector banks in India will cut down their exposure which means that getting finance for purchase of rough diamonds will become difficult. India is a major cutting and polishing hub of diamonds. If rough supply comes down then it will also hit manufacturing activity which in turn will have an impact on exports.”

Pandya said GJEPC was trying to meet officials of the Reserve and finance ministry to make them understand that the trade should not be punished because there were a few fraudulent players."

I am very happy to see that despite a very conventional mindset, a significant part of our population has given up the arrogance of assuming that money will continue forever the way it has been used. We are accepting that there is an evolution. Even now, the total number of people who are doing this in India is roughly around half a crore or 5 million. This can go in two directions. Unless the regulators did something drastic, this can only increase. There are certain intrinsic qualities about cryptocurrency which makes them very appealing to a certain category of users. If, however, the government takes a very adverse view of this, I do not know whether we would be stifling innovation in that case.

Do you see any chances of government going the other way round?

It goes this way. I am a citizen and I have earned some money and I am holding it in my bank account. After having understood the risk, if I want to buy Bitcoin, should anybody be able to tell me that I cannot do that as it is dangerous for my neighbours if I have it? At the level of purchasing or possessing, I do not see India as one of those very underdeveloped countries in the world which are banning Bitcoin. I see India in the league of countries like USA, UK, Singapore, Italy, Switzerland, etc, where at least I do not see the government taking any adverse action. There could be certain steps in the interest of consumer security. Exchanges and interfaces and wallets and people in the Bitcoin industry, have to follow certain regulations which we as a company as well as an industry totally welcome.

The latest news is that HDFC pulled out of some of the Bitcoin exchanges. They were the the last of the top private banks remaining in the Bitcoin exchange ecosystem. Is that a warning or is there any communication from the government side to the banking system to get out of it?

I have a huge amount of conviction in Bitcoins. I have seen RTI queries addressed to the Reserve Bank of India, asking them whether there was any such indication, circular notification, etc, sent to banks to withdraw banking services and the answer is a very clear no. RBI has not done anything.

Looking at banks in general, the banks have to appreciate that they are being given a monopolistic position by the regulations of this country. Only they can be banks. Like tomorrow, if I say oh this bank is offering me services, it cannot become a bank. In a grave misuse of the monopolistic powers, the banks prevent investment in a sector of the fintech industry, which is us.

If you have a bank account and you want to buy Bitcoin after knowing all the risks factors, I do not see how a bank can forbid you from doing that. If underlying assets were banned, if RBI had said Bitcoin cannot be purchased in India or the Government of India had said that, they would say this is not an asset class that you can purchase. That has not happened so for banks to take an action like this is irrational overreach and frankly very disappointing. I think they are grossly misusing their monopolistic power.

Is there any way that Bitcoin exchanges can be seen as an alternative to fiat currency? The government has made its stand very clear that it is not going to be a legal tender. Is there a way for Bitcoin exchanges to perform or to work even outside the banking system?

Bitcoin can operate peer to peer. You and I can transact Bitcoins. Banks do not come into the picture. Is this what the government wants? That infinite number of people with complete anonymity start transacting, buying, selling and there is no way to reach them? If they go with the exchange mechanism, in fact we would tell the government that the exchanges are your best friend because we can provide you all the KYC data. You give us a PAN number, we will tell you how many transactions the person has done, etc. We are recommending that let us remain within the banking system because then, everything can be tracked and there is a trail. If the banks stop allowing bitcoin purchase through them, the transactions will still happen, except that nobody will ever know. I do not think this is good for India."
389,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 09:50 AM IST",Bloomberg,Stocks,Investing while distracted in the Trump era,"By Barry Ritholtz

That is the question we must all wrestle with in the Trump era.

An endless stream of tweets, announcements, firings, policy shifts, outrages and absurdities greet us each day — and that is before the market even opens. Psychographic microtargeting, the president and the porn star, CPR for gunshot victims, fine people among neo-Nazis — events and ideas that in the context of US political life would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

Investors can easily fall down this rabbit hole, where their adventures are filled with nonsensical distractions.

Let me try to offer a few words of advice that might be helpful during the next two-plus (or six-plus) years of distractions that go hand-in-hand with the presidency of Donald Trump. These won’t help you beat the market, but they should

a) help you avoid falling too far behind, and

b) make sense of the nonsense. On to the lumber yard:

STICK TO YOUR PLAN: This is obvious, but it needs to be said: Whatever your plan is, execute it. This remains true regardless of what your investment strategy may be. If you are a value investor, well then, go find cheap stocks. If you are a trend follower, look for asset classes in defined up or down trends, and trade accordingly. Momentum investors seek out momentum.

Unless your investment model is interpreting news flow to determine trades, then the ephemeral background noise shouldn’t distract you. So then ask yourself:

WHY ARE YOU SO DISTRACTED?

This is a question all traders and investors must put to themselves. Figuring out why it’s so hard to avert your eyes and ears from all the sturm und drang could help you manage it better. Are your investments suffering declines? Are returns not what was predicted by back tests? Or are you simply frustrated with or bored by these markets?

I am not suggesting you ignore a substantial flaw in your methodology; but I am suggesting not misdiagnosing the background static or normal market volatility for a systemic error. It is too easy to lose sight of the important signal among all of the noise. Learn to separate the two. You can do this by:

MANAGING YOUR MEDIA CONSUMPTION

Perhaps the problem is that you are overconsuming the daily firehose of news and commentary. It is too easy to believe a half-dozen provably false things before breakfast.

A few solutions beckon: No. 1. Throttle back your input. Less is more in this case
No. 2. Focus on the quality of what you read, not the quantity

No. 3. Avoid the bias of getting lost in a media bubble of your own making

No. 4. Use technology to make all of this easier I use cheap and simple tech to help organize my daily routine.

Chrome tabs allow me to quickly sift through the morning news. I open lots of AM and PM tabs, then work my way through by scanning and closing them. This works well in conjunction with Instapaper’s save-for-later feature -- it lets me create lists of items to read when I am less pressed for time. It also helps to reduce time on Facebook, and to learn to use Twitter as an intelligent research assistant. Each will go a long way toward helping manage the endless static. But there’s one more thing:

LEARN NEW SKILLS : One of the great pleasures of youth is the simple joy of learning. Once we graduate from school, we forget the invigorating thrill of acquiring new skills. Embracing new concepts and challenges can be a wonderfully healthy distraction, a cleansing for a weary soul.

For me, it is a mixture of tennis (a game I came to late in life), learning French and cooking.

There is a lovely and pure goodness to undertaking new challenges. Stepping away from your daily grind is to refresh and recharge, and can only be helpful to your daily work. It also provides much-needed relief to whatever it is that you are obsessing over. This is a polite way to tell you to stop whatever it is you are doing and get out of the office.

Perhaps the biggest risk of the fake-news era is the natural tendency to go among mad people. Don’t get lost in the salacious details of meaningless ephemera. My advice is to focus on what matters: Add context, perspective and balance to data and supporting or contrary evidence. Almost everything else is a distraction."

The incident came amid the nationwide outrage over the CBSE exam paper leaks, in which three people have been arrested by the Delhi Police's Crime Branch.

The FCI's exam for the post of watchman was supposed to be held at various centres in MP yesterday.

The aspirants were asked to pay Rs 5 lakh each for the question paper, according to a release issued by the STF yesterday.

However, the STF official said she was not sure if the exam was held as scheduled for the advertised post.

""Acting on a tip-off, the Bhopal and Gwalior STF teams caught two agents and 48 aspirants on Saturday late night from Siddharth Palace hotel in Gwalior for leaking the watchman recruitment examination paper of the FCI,"" the STF release said here last night.

The arrested agents were identified as Ashutosh Kumar and Harish Kumar, both residents of Delhi.

The STF seized a hand-written question paper and an answer sheet from the accused.

""During the interrogation, the candidates revealed that each of them was asked to pay Rs 5 lakh for the question paper with solved answers. They were asked to pay the amount after being selected for the post,"" the release said.

A case was registered and an investigation was underway, it said.

Notably, there has been a widespread outrage over the CBSE exam paper leaks, prompting the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry to suspend one board official yesterday and initiate a probe.

The Delhi Police's Crime Branch also arrested three persons, including two teachers of a private school, for their alleged involvement in the leak of the Class 12 CBSE economics paper.

Mounting pressure on the government, the Congress had demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi speak out on the matter."

396,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 10:31 AM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,Insurance companies create policies to protect IRPs,"MUMBAI: After large firms, insurance brokers are now designing policies to cover individual insolvency professionals against charges of sabotage and negligence during the timebound resolution of bankruptcy cases.

The insolvency resolution professional is appointed as the CEO in charge of a company by lenders during the bankruptcy proceedings at dedicated insolvency courts. Many default cases are now being tried under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and there are mounting concerns that IRPs may be exposed to litigation by erstwhile promoters and managements.

IRPs are typically attached to accounting firms. Insurance brokers are in touch with insolvency professionals who have received some work or the other in some form. They have made representations to the committees of creditors (CoC) to make the policy compulsory for all IRPs.


“Insurance brokers are in touch with 750 IRPs who have received some work or the other in some form,” said Amit Agarwal, director, JLT Independent Insurance Brokers. “We have made representations to CoCs to make the policy compulsory for all IRPs.”

Larger assignments were among the first to be covered under such an insurance shield. Smaller IRPs are paid lower fees and they may find the policy expensive. If it is made compulsory for IRPs to buy the cover, it may dissuade them from taking new assignments. The policy covers IRPs for seven years. Agarwal said that if the CoC could bear the cost of the policy, individual IRPs would have the requisite insurance cover.

“We have made representations to CoCs to make the policy compulsory for IRPs. If the CoC could bear the cost of the policy, individual IRPs would have the policy in hand. IRPs are covered for $2 million to $30 million,” said Agarwal.

The policy available in the market covers directors’ and officers’ liability and professional indemnity arising as a result of errors and omissions. Insurance brokers have brought in policies to provide cover to crisis responses, such as instances of kidnapping and demands for ransom."

Raising of interest rates by the US Fed could disturb FPI flows into emerging markets. In this background, India needs domestic flows led by SIPs to sustain in the coming months. In our opinion, markets are expected to be relatively more volatile in FY19 than in FY18, Chordia said.

Based on various brokerage recommendations, here are 11 stock strategies that can potentially deliver handsome gains over the next three weeks.

Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit NSE 0.94 % Financial Services

Petronet LNG NSE -0.36 % | BUY | Target Price: Rs 245-258 | Stop loss: Rs 216

Weekly charts show this stock has been on a gentle slope, in stark contrast with violent bear swings in the index. The present correction has completed the 61.8 per cent retracement of the March 2017 to March 2018 move, and is presently seen taking support from the 2017’s breakout levels. A flag that is in the formation on the counter may take longer to mature, and it would be advisable to look for dips to allow the flag enough time to signal a bullish continuation, which could aim for Rs 245 to Rs 258 level.

Muthoot Finance NSE 0.25 % | BUY | Target Price: Rs 423-440 | Stop loss: Rs 390

Muthoot Finance has been on a slippery slope ever since it formed a double top in November 2017, shaving nearly 30 per cent from the top. However, at Rs 370 level, this stock looks to have attracted enough strength to break free of the bear grip. The breakout move from the bear pattern may face initial test of strength at Rs 423, the weekly 20DMA, and thereafter Rs 440.

Sobha | BUY | Target Price: Rs 580 | Stop loss: Rs 471

Sobha had embarked on a directional move only as recent as 2017 having gone through a multi-year consolidation. So, the uptrend is relatively quite young, which raises the potential for 2017’s breakout levels to attract buying interest, and place the stock back into the upside trajectory. Last week’s fall has been quickly recouped and the close above the lower Bollinger band in weekly chart supports the positive view.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

JK Cement | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,151 | Stop loss: Rs 970

After recent correction from the high of Rs 1,195, this counter appears to have bottomed out ahead of the market, as it is hovering around the Rs 1,000 mark for last four weeks. Even the correction witnessed in last two sessions in the broader market failed to demotivate the bulls from holding on to this counter. If the market stabilises, this counter can retest its lifetime highs.

Exide Industries NSE 0.00 % | BUY | Target Price: Rs 237 | Stop loss: Rs 210

After registering a low of Rs 192 in February 2018, this counter appears to have started a fresh leg of upmove as it is steadily witnessing a higher tops- higher bottoms kind of formation, suggesting end of the correction. Considering the volatility in the market and the uptrend on this counter, traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on declines up to Rs 215 level.

Bosch | BUY | Target Price: Rs 20,020 | Stop loss: Rs 16,900

Albeit this counter is in an intermediate downtrend and underperformed the market, it appears to have posted a short-term bottom around 16,975 a week back and since then it has been on a pullback mode. This counter trend move can last for quite some time as it is coming after a bigger correction and hence can extend up to its interim top of Rs 20,000 level. Positional traders are advised to buy now and add on declines up to Rs 17,300 level.

Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA

Oberoi Realty | BUY | Target Price: Rs 550 | Stop loss: Rs 485

Since the beginning of 2018, this stock has remained in a broad trading range forming multiple tops and multiple bottoms in the range of Rs 560-Rs 490. The stock has rebounded once again from a strong pattern support area and has ended above its short term 20-DMA. Also, a big white candle emerged and it remains significant as it emerged near a support area with higher volumes. The MACD is moving towards positive crossover. RSI is neutral, but is seen marking higher bottoms. A buy signal in Stochastic also occurred with a bullish divergence against the price.

DMart | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,400 | Stop loss: Rs 1,295

This stock ended above its upper Bollinger band a week before but saw a short term pullback inside the band. However, few signals have emerged which point towards likely return of momentum over coming days. The RSI is neutral and it is seen taking a pattern support. The weekly MACD is in continuing buy mode. The weekly RSI, too, has marked a higher bottom and is seen inching higher. Upward revision in price over coming days cannot be ruled out.

Vaishali Parekh, Research Analyst, Technical Research, Prabhudas Lilladher

SBI | BUY | Target Price: Rs 270 | Stop loss: Rs 225

This stock has witnessed a deep correction from the peak of Rs 332 to bottom out around the Rs 232 level and has indicated a pullback with a positive candle pattern in the daily chart. It signifies a positive bias with the RSI showing a steep trend reversal from the highly oversold zone. With the volume participation being decent and the chart looking attractive, we recommend a buy at current levels.

Shriram Transport Finance Company NSE 0.17 % | BUY | Target Price: Rs 1,550 | Stop loss: Rs 1,350

This stock has made more or less a higher bottom formation pattern in the daily chart at around Rs 1,275 level and has made a good recovery path to maintain a positive bias. Currently, it is ruling above the significant moving average of 34 WMA and we anticipate a further upward rise from here on in the coming days. With the RSI on the rise and also the MACD showing a positive indication, we recommend a buy in this stock.

Greaves Cotton | BUY | Target Price: Rs 128 | Stop loss: Rs 107

This stock has witnessed erosion to the tune of almost 27 per cent from the peak of Rs 154 to bottom out at around Rs 113 level to form a double bottom formation in the daily chart. The chart looks attractive for a pullback from here on with the positive indicators. The RSI indicating a trend reversal from the oversold zone has given a buy signal.

403,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 10:19 AM IST",ETMarkets.com,Expert Views,HNIs are building long-term portfolios in equities: Chintan Modi,"Chintan Modi, Executive Vice President, IIFL, says thanks to financialisation of savings post demonetisation, people are mostly investing in equities. Modi was speaking at the ETMarkets Global Summit 2018.

Edited excerpts:


Where people are investing these days? Which are the preferred asset classes?

I will tell you what all asset classes are available in market. Normally, people invest in commodities or real estate or equities. Thanks to financialisation of savings post demonetisation, people are mostly investing in equities. Debt is also not doing well in India because of reduced interest rate. Both HNIs as well as retail investors will invest in equities as they expect better return because of improved dynamics in India and globally.

If you ask specifically for HNIs, then HNIs are building their long-term portfolios in equities but they are very hooked to products like AIF, PMS which are of unique nature where they feel that these products are good for making money in the longer run. They want to park and enjoy benefits of equities through different means, not only by building a portfolio directly in equities. Apart for the mutual fund portfolio, mutual fund is the asset class where everyone is investing in India as of now.

How flows are coming from tier II and tier III cities?

Financialisation of savings has certainly helped us to mobilise great amount of flow from tier II and tier III cities. We have seen many fund houses, many brokers also building up their networks in tier II and III cities, special incentives, special branches, special partners in order to ensure that these flow, means maximum share of this portfolio comes to them. So tier II and tier III cities are the cities where competition is less and a lot of opportunities, less awareness, financial literacy can also be focussed upon and their savings can also be channelised in financial markets. The tier II and tier III cities for next couple of years, will add more in terms of volume growth of AUM to new financial avenues or to mutual fund. Compared to tier I, tier II and tier III cities will do well.

Which reforms are needed in the commodity space?

In order to enhance participation of farmers in commodity space, you need a robust spot market. They can hedge or deliver their portfolio, they can come on future exchange easily if they have the knowledge. What is more important in commodities market right now participation. Participation of value chain is required in commodity market.

Thanks to Sebi as a regulator now, we have opportunity of introducing various products in commodities and these products will definitely bring various participants also in market products like PMS will be allowed.

Options are already there. And other products like index based products, exchange based products will be allowed in markets soon. So, with that participants like AIF will be there. Foreign institutional investors will be allowed or banks and AMCs will be allowed to participate in commodity market.

The liquidity and depth of the market will increase. You will see more number of value participants coming in. They are hedging their portfolio outside India, because they do not find liquidity in contracts. Once you have more number of participants in India and depth and liquidity in the market, definitely bigger corporates, bigger institutions will come and participate and with their participation the entire value chain will get benefit. There will be a robust infrastructure. There will be a robust warehousing system and all. Delivery mechanism and everything will enhance significantly.

All that will add significant value. So, apart from larger participation what you need is better infrastructure to handle smaller participants like farmer, education to them so that is what is required as of now. Sebi as a regulator has done various steps and we are very gung ho that next few years will be very good for commodities.

How do you see the scenario of commodities coming into stock exchanges?

Sebi has floated the universal exchange concept. From October onwards, you will see two or three more exchanges coming out with commodities. So, whenever, you have more exchanges, more competition in market, you will see more innovation, more products, more participants so that will certainly add to the volume of Indian commodity markets and that is what is required right now in order to increase depth and liquidity in the market.

And innovation of products will attract players not only in India; I heard few days back that there is a thought that they will allow foreign participants, the FPIs also to invest in commodity markets. All these are very positive steps. There will be some competition initially. Everyone will try to eat other’s market share. Equity exchanges will try to eat commodities market share. Commodity exchanges will try to eat some share of equities.

But from participants’ point of view, from investor point of view, they will have more options. All this will certainly be good for Indian ecosystem and for the Indian commodity market.

What is your take on base metals?

There is a synchronised recovery, global recovery. We are getting positive vibes from China because China is not crashing that much. Somewhere they have stabilised. They have curtailed their output because of pollution control at their end and they will continue that curtailment of output or production for quite some time that is what we are expecting.

The data from US or data from UK or Europe are also on a positive note be it PMI data or GDP data or increase in inflation, everything is positive indicating that yes there is a global synchronised recovery which will add to demand increase of base metals and all.

Big projects like OBOR and all One Belt One Road project which is launched by China will also add significant demand of base metals. Considering that we are quite hopeful that base metals will certainly do well.

Where are HNIs investing?

HNIs today are investing in equities but even in equities, they look forward to unique opportunities in the market. There are many players who are providing unique opportunities in AIF and PMS. Such opportunities are available and suit the HNI clients and they can invest any amount. When you have a new concept, wherein they feel there is a probability of making money, then even putting a Rs 50 crore or Rs 100 crore is not a challenge for them. New and new concept attract lot of money even in equities also."

Supriyo, however, tried to explain that his abuses were an expression of anger, and they were actually aimed at a couple of TMC cadres. Meanwhile, all political parties in West Bengal and outside condemned his comments.

“You may be surprised to know that after two dirty incidents in Asansol. I had met our honourable PM resigning as a minister to quit politics and power for good only to be inspired back by our honourable PM, a man who works 24/7/365 days for his country,” he wrote on his micro blogging site. “Don’t Quit -- Fight” was what the PM had advised Supriyo, he claimed.

Despite repeated attempts to contact him, Supriyo remained unavailable for comments.

KIBITHU/KAHO (ARUNACHAL PRADESH): 'Welcome to China' suddenly pops up on the screen of one's mobile phone, which has been dead for several hours, as one heads towards the border on a single, narrow and extremely bumpy road.

Displaying characters in Mandarin to indicate full connectivity, the phone promptly switches to Beijing time, which is two-and-a-half hours ahead of India. You then look across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to see the sprawling Tatu military complex of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which even includes a three-storey building, connected by a smooth, wide, seemingly metalled road.

""But we have no connectivity, whether it is roads or mobiles. It takes a mental toll. Even the evacuation of an injured soldier becomes a huge logistical challenge since the only road coming to Kibithu from Tezu is frequently blocked by landslides,"" says an Indian Army officer, keeping tabs on the PLA troops across the unresolved border in this 'east of the north-east' region.

""If the road is cut off during hostilities, we will not be able to move troops or equipment. The main operational challenge for us here is the lack of roads, bridges and inter-valley connectivity, not military equipment or manpower,"" he adds. In the entire Lohit Valley sector, for instance, there is no concrete bridge after Hawai, which is 76km south of Kibithu.


Consequently, the Army is forced to make do with rickety foot-suspension bridges over the Lohit river, called Ngi Chu across the LAC, and an optical fibre communication line, which was laid way back in 2003 and has to be ""maintained"" on a daily basis over a 280-km stretch.

This grim situation is repeated all along the unresolved 4,057-km LAC stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, with India's lack of border military infrastructure only serving to further compound the stark asymmetry with China in terms of military capabilities.

China's assiduous building of military infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region, which includes 14 airbases, an extensive rail network and over 58,000km of roads, gives it the capability to swiftly induct and sustain 30-32 divisions (each with over 12,000 troops) against India.

But this last-mile connectivity for Indian troops remains a distant dream till now. Only 28 of the 73 'strategic' all-weather roads, with more east-west lateral links as well as better access routes to strategic peaks and valleys, identified for construction almost two decades ago have been fully completed till now.

In eastern Arunachal Pradesh, for instance, the road heads are around 20 to 70 km away from the LAC in most stretches, forcing Indian troops to regularly undertake long-range patrols to ""physically dominate"" the country's claim lines in the treacherous terrain. ""Unlike us, the Chinese troops largely remain in their rear areas because they can reinforce fast due to their infrastructure build-up,"" says an officer.

There is now a renewed but belated thrust on road and communication connectivity in the region, which has speeded up after the 73-day troop faceoff at Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction last year.

""We are working on 17 single-span bridges in the Lohit Valley area, which will be 35-to 74-metre long and capable of even carrying tanks. We are also working on a major bailey suspension bridge, which will be the first such one between Hawai and Kibithu,"" says Colonel Rajeev Dhingra, commander of the 48 Border Road Task-Force. The soldiers are keeping their fingers crossed."

Patna: The growing proximity between JD(U) leader and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and LJP chief and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan has raised speculation of a possible front, primarily to put pressure on BJP, ahead of the 2019 general elections.

Taking into account the recent communal clashes and BJP’s “aggressive” stand and RJD’s offensive against the Bihar government on law and order, JD(U) and LJP fear that they may get alienated from Muslims and Dalits. Now that Jitan Ram Manjhi has already quit NDA and joined the RJD-led “grand-alliance” and a possible entry of Union minister Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP is on the cards, Nitish and Paswan fear that RJD would broaden its base in its fight against BJP.

LJP sources said Paswan and Nitish have met at least four times in the past six months. Nitish, along with Kushwaha, is scheduled to attend the national convention of Dalit Sena, LJP’s backbone, in Patna on April 14. They say the CM may announce the inclusion of Paswans in the Mahadalit category.

“When Nitish created Mahadalit category, he kept Paswans out of it, instead put them in Dalit category. But the equation between Paswan and Nitish seems to have changed recently. We’ve been told that Nitish may include Paswans in Mahadalit category at the April 14 convention,” a senior LJP functionary told TOI on Sunday.

Paswan fears a dent in his Dalit vote bank, especially after the recent communal clashes, sources said. In a presser, he also expressed concern over a “few BJP leaders” creating an impression that NDA was against certain sections of society.

Kushwaha has been given an “open invitation” by RJD to join the grand-alliance. He fuelled speculation by meeting Lalu Prasad last Thursday at AIIMS in New Delhi where the RJD chief has been undergoing treatment.

BJP, however, refuted reports of Paswan trying form a separate front. A senior BJP functionary said deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had been invited by Paswan in the April 14 convention of Dalit Sena. “Sushil Modi has also been invited and he is most likely to attend it as well, but that does not mean that they are going to form a separate front. People like Sushil Modi would live and die being in BJP,” he said.

RJD claimed that Paswan was going to join the grandalliance. “Talks are being held internally between RJD and Paswan and he would soon join the grand-alliance. Paswan is feeling suffocated in NDA. When I had said that Manjhi may join us, BJP denied that. But my prediction became reality and the same would happen in case of Paswan,” RJD national vicepresident Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said."

CHENNAI: With large deals drying up, private equity (PE) companies invested about $3.7 billion (across 133 deals) during the quarter ended March 2018, down 49% compared to $7.3 billion (in 200 transactions) in the same period last year and 29% lower on a sequential basis.

“The latest quarter witnessed only nine PE investments worth $100 million or more compared to 13 such transactions in the same period last year,” said Arun Natarajan, CEO of Venture Intelligence. “Also notable was the fact that Softbank — which dominated 2017 with its mega e-commerce bets on Flipkart, Paytm, Ola and Oyo — did not figure among the top ten deals in Q1 2018,” he added. The only Indian investment by the Japanese giant so far in 2018 has been the relatively small follow-on investment (400 crore or $61 million) in Grofers.

The largest PE investment in January-March was $1.1 billion preferential allotment by HDFC to investors, includin
g GIC, KKR and others (Canada Pension Plan OMERS, Carmignac Group and Premji Invest). This was followed by the $275 million investment by TPG Capital in the resultant entity of the merger between Manipal Hospitals and Fortis Healthcare.

I would not like to comment on it. But the key point here is if CBI’s name is linked to any stock name, then irrespective of the outcome, in the near term, that creates uncertainty. The biggest thing the markets dislike is uncertainty. Till the time CBI does not come up with its findings and the final outcome, it will be always a hanging story. Every three- four months, there will be some development and it will keep on going for three-four years. So, that is a real problem.

But at the same time as everyone has been saying that the bank is good and valuations are dirt cheap. If CBI clears the story very fast, then it will be really good for ICICI Bank. Otherwise, it is going to be problematic.

Canara Bank NSE -0.13 % has said that there is value in Can Fin Homes NSE 1.37 %, value that investors have not been able to measure up to just as yet and so they will abandon the stake sale that was planned. What is the view?

We do not cover the stock but broadly speaking if the value which was expected by the investors through the Can Fin Homes stake sale is not coming through, then it is not going to be positive for the bank because the bank definitely needs capital and this was one of the ways to get capital. If that is not available, then it is definitely not positive for the stock."

It was an emotional reunion for the Dalai Lama and Naren Chandra Das, an 80-year-old, who was a strapping soldier when they first met in 1959. After his daring escape from Tibet following the Chinese invasion, Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama (then 22) was escorted safely to Indian soil by Naren Chandra Das, who was 23 years old then. They were accompanied by six soldiers of Assam Rifles at Tawang on March 31, 1959.

In the last 60 years, they met only once at Guwahati last April. The Dalai Lama thanked India for providing shelter to him and his countrymen and invited Das to McLeodganj. Despite poor health, Das accepted the invitation and was given VVIP treatment during the function.

The entire cabinet of the Tibetan government-in-exile arrived for the function in which Dalai Lama was accompanied by Tibetan Prime Minister Lobsang Sangay. At the Tsuglakhang (main temple), the venue for the function, the first thing the Dalai Lama did was to head towards Naren Chandra Das and embrace him warmly.

When Dalai Lama honoured the guests, Das was the only person to get another warm hug from the Tibetan spiritual leader. When people came to know about Das’s role in ensuring the Dalai Lama’s safety 60 years back, they could not resist taking selfies with him.

The Dalai Lama entered India from Chuthangmo in Arunachal Pradesh on March 31, 1959. Das, a resident of Sonitpur district of Assam, was among a group of seven Indian soldiers from 5 Assam rifles, who escorted Dalai Lama to safety. He is now the lone survivor of that group of soldiers.

“We are happy to see this man. He received Dalai Lama on Indian soil, due to which we feel an emotional connection with him,” said a visitor.

Reciprocating the love, Das said he is too fragile to travel long distances now but came to meet the Dalai Lama because of the shared past.

“I am not well and unable to travel. I took the risk of travel only for Dalai Lama,” he said. Recalling the day he met the Tibetan spiritual leader for the first time, Das said Dalai Lama was on horseback with around 20 of his bodyguards when he entered India.

Recalling their last meeting in Guwahati, Das said, “I am very happy and proud of the stature he has attained as a global spiritual leader in the last 60 years.”"

424,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 10:59 AM IST",ET CONTRIBUTORS,Money,Applying for a business loan: It's important to understand the process,"By Rishi Mehra

Applying for a business loan is not the same as applying for an individual loan. The requirements are more stringent and the paperwork greater. Hence, it is important to understand the process and the steps involved.

The reason for the loan
The first bit is to understand why you need the money and the loan. Business needs can be different, which means the loan requirement would be different. The reason will also mean you would be able to quantify the amount of money you need and different products available in the market. For example, if the loan is required to buy machinery, there are a number of banks and NBFCs that provide equipment and machinery loan and equipment finance. Therefore, knowing the need for the loan is sometimes vital.

Books of account
One of the most vital components behind any bank loan is to have your finances in order. This is especially true today when banks have tightened their lending criteria and are very particular about whom they extend a loan to. Keeping proper books of accounts is very important and before applying for a loan, it is vital that you go through them to weed out any discrepancies or errors. Banks generally ask for the balance sheet of the company, profit and loss accounts, cash flow statement, tax audit reports and statutory audit report. These have to be for the last 3 years in audited/provisional financials. You will also need one year Income Tax returns of your company.

Get your answers ready
Beyond the financial statements, you would also need to get some more documents and answers to questions that the bank may pose to you. Current year performance and projected turnover on letterhead of the entity would be required and it is important to get this right. If, for example, the loan is to execute a specific project, you would need to provide a detailed project report containing details of the project, cost involved, ways to finance it, and projections. In some cases you may need to provide government approvals for power, pollution, fire and safety, building plans along with documentary proofs. If you are buying a machinery or any other asset, you would need to submit, and where it is the case of purchasing a piece of land, it can be the copy of allotment letter/conveyance deed in case of land. The answers and the supporting document you would need would vary according to need of the loan and it would be prudent to get this part sorted.

Credit rating
It is surprising that businesses often do not understand the value of getting a credit rating for their enterprise. A good credit rating can bring a substantial difference in the interest rate you are charged by a bank and can in fact be deciding factor in getting your loan approved. A credit rating is extensive in nature and looks beyond the financial bits of a business. Most ratings do a comprehensive risk analysis that look at financial strength, industry dynamics, competitive position of the entity, operating efficiency, management capability, organization systems, customer profile, track record with lenders and other stakeholders. Banks feel much more comfortable if your business has a credit rating and hence, before you go for a bank loan, you may want to get your business analyzed and rated.

Homework - It is very important to do some homework before you get on with the process. Different banks have different requirements and products. See what suits you the best and what may work out for you. Shortlist a few banks or NBFCs that you may want to approach and like a bank carries out its due diligence, you should keep a close watch on what is offered to you in terms of a loan. While we often only look at interest rates, there are many other aspects to consider before we decide which offer to take.

BENGALURU: Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Sunday that he was personally not in favour of linking Aadhaar cards with electoral photo-identity cards (EPIC) of voters as the two serve different purposes.

""I am not saying this as an IT minister... My personal opinion is Aadhaar should not be linked with the voter ID card,"" Prasad said at an event here.

He said the government was not willing to face accusations of spying on people. ""If we do this, our detractors will say, 'PM Narendra Modi is snooping on us to know what we eat, which movie we are watching' and so on. I don't want that to happen,"" the minister said.

The EPIC card has been linked with the web portal of the Election Commission of India and you will get election-related information such as your polling booth and its address. Aadhaar is not related to this,"" he said.

The minister, however, strongly defended the linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts, saying it would bring in transparency in reaching the benefits of welfare schemes through direct benefit transfer (DBT). ""There is a clear difference between the Aadhaar of Modi and the Aadhaar of Manmohan Singh. While Singh's Aadhaar had no support of law, Modi's Aadhaar is backed by law, and security and privacy are completely ensured,"" he said.

He sought to highlight that over 80 crore mobile phones had been linked to bank accounts as part of the Centre's JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile numbers) trinity. He said over 31 crore Jan Dhan accounts had been opened and over 120 crore mobiles had been linked to Aadhar.

""Once former PM Rajiv Gandhi had said that of the one rupee spent by the government for welfare of the downtrodden, only 15 paise reach the needy. Now, if the government sends Rs 1,000, it directly gets deposited in the bank account of the beneficiary,"" he added.

Defending the need of the unique identification number, he said Aadhaar is the digital identity that supplements the physical identity of people. ""If you want to travel by train, you have to buy ticket online for which you have to give data. If you don't want to give data, then take a bicycle. If you want to eat at a restaurant, you will get an electronically-generated invoice and people will know what you have eaten. But the government respects privacy and the data is perfectly secure,"" he said. The minister said the government would not tolerate any unauthorised use of data for abuse."

What is enemy property?
After the 1962 conflict with China and the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war, the Indian government seized properties belonging to nationals of these countries. These properties, designated enemy property included land, buildings, firms, shares, bank balance, provident fund and so on. These properties are administrated by the Custodian of Enemy Property for India. The properties were seized in response to ‘enemy’ countries failing to compensate Indians whose property was seized or who fled these countries because of the war.

What is the valuation of these immovable properties?
Responding to a question in Lok Sabha in 2017 the home ministry gave out details of 9,280 of these immovable properties that Pakistani nationals had to leave behind. Overall the property is spread across 12,000 acres of land and valued at over Rs 1 lakh crore.


Was there an international agreement on these properties?
In the 1966 Tashkent Declaration following the war between India and Pakistan, a clause was included that the two countries would discuss return of property and assets taken over by either side in connection to the conflict. The Pakistan government, however, sold all enemy property and assets owned by Indian citizens and companies in 1971 itself. In India, such properties continue to be under the control of the Custodian of Enemy Property.

Which state has the highest number of such properties?
Together UP and West Bengal have over 80% of these immovable properties. Over 98% of it belongs to Pakistani nationals.


Is it the first time such a rule is being enacted in India?
No. After the beginning of the Second World War the British had enacted a Defence of India Act in 1939. Under this Act Germany, Italy and Japan were declared enemy countries and similar measures were adopted so their citizens should not be allowed to have any financial gain from India.

NEW DELHI: Most parts of north India can expect a searing hot summer this year with average mean temperatures remaining more than a degree above normal, the India Meteorological Department said in its countrywide hot weather outlook for April, May and June on Sunday.

While north India is likely to see the highest temperature deviations — which also indicates drier-than-usual weather in that region — IMD’s outlook says the average seasonal temperatures over most subdivisions of the country could be above normal. The regions with slightly lower-than-normal projected temperatures are eastern, east-central and southern parts of the country, the outlook stated.

“North India is expected to be mainly dry with clear skies and anti-cyclonic winds that raise temperatures. The higher than normal temperatures there seem to be linked with global warming signals,” said D Sivananda Pai, head of IMD’s long-range forecasting division.



“Maximum temperatures in south and east India could be closer to normal, indicating cloudiness and good pre-monsoon showers in these regions,” Pai said.

Although the upcoming season in the north will be hotter than normal, the forecast added that the season’s average temperatures in most subdivisions are likely to be less than what was seen last year. The season is likely to see the usual number of heat waves over the core heat wave (HW) zone of the country, the department said although there’s a 38% probability of above-normal heat wave conditions.

The HW zone covers states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, UP, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa and Telangana, as well as meteorological subdivisions of Marathawada, Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra and coastal Andhra Pradesh.

The forecast said average maximum temperatures — which regulate daytime conditions — are expected to be higher than normal by one degree or more in J&K, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi. They are likely to be between one and 0.5 degrees higher than normal in Uttarakhand, west Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The remaining subdivisions are likely to experience near normal maximum temperature anomalies.

Night temperatures too are projected to be higher than one degree above normal in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana (including Delhi and Chandigarh, west Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan."

The US jobs report was already playing second fiddle to inflation data in the minds of bond traders. But after last week’s turbulence in technology stocks, it almost feels like an afterthought.

Benchmark 10-year Treasuries are coming off their biggest rally of 2018, with yields at seven-week lows. This time, it wasn’t geopolitical risk fuelling the gains, or even weak inflation figures (the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge, in fact, beat analysts’ estimates). Rather, it was investors seeking refuge from the volatility in equity-market darlings such as Amazon.com , Facebook and Tesla.

That dynamic looks unlikely to change in the coming days, even though the latest update on the US labour market looms at week’s end. Of course, part of why payrolls have lost some of their oomph is because they’ve been strong for so long. March looks to be no different: Employers probably added 1,89,000 workers, around the average for the past year.

With that steady jobs market in mind, the start of April gives traders a chance to assess the Treasuries market after its most punishing quarter since 2016. Bond bulls have ample cause for hope: Yield curves are the flattest in a decade, and that 3 per cent mark on the 10-year yield is just getting further and further away.

‘SLOW BLEED’

“What has reset the levels here is the persistence of equity volatility,” Greg Peters, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said. It’s “had a slow bleed into the rate market.” The 10-year yield fell seven basis points last week to 2.74 per cent, declining through a key resistance level that held for weeks. The 30-year yield closed below 3 per cent for the first time since January. Meanwhile, shorter maturities were little changed, leaving the yield curve from 2 to 30 years at the flattest since 2007.

Two-year notes remain locked in place because expectations for rate hikes have barely budged — fed funds futures are still pricing in about two more increases for this year.

“There’s a lot of selling pressure that’s going on at the short end that could continue to weigh on the markets and push short rates higher,” said Kathleen Gaffney, a fixed-income money manager at Eaton Vance Management. “You could see an inverted curve simply because of the technicals.”

BRIGHT SPOTS

There are a couple bright spots for the short end. For one thing, the deluge of supply is finally starting to ease. The Treasury’s auctions of three- and six-month bills this week will each be $3 billion smaller, after swelling to records in recent weeks. And the London interbank offered rate has started to climb at a slower pace.

But for the time being, it’s the spectre of market volatility that appears to be the main driver for rates. The S&P 500 Index is coming off its first quarterly loss since 2015. Whether that’s seen as a healthy correction or the start of something bigger is likely a key to the path of Treasuries from here.

That means for the second year in a row, predicting the start of a bond bear market is looking like a fool’s errand.

“We thought this year was different, that there was enough momentum,” said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed-income capital markets at Raymond NSE 1.03 % James. But with “an administration that is so unpredictable, a potential trade war, and now a fallout in the equity market,” things aren’t so clear, he said."
436,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 11:32 AM IST",ET Bureau,Panache,New wedding trend: Millennial couples shake a leg on their D-day with choreographed videos,"Three months back, when twenty something entrepreneurs Nirbhay and Pragya Surana were getting married, they wanted to do a different take with their Save the Date invite.

So, the couple chose to shake a leg for a 4-minute pre-wedding video, the trailer of which was shared with family and friends over WhatsApp and social media. “It was a lot of fun and we took a day to shoot the entire sequence impromptu. Our near and dear ones were thrilled to see the final outcome,” says the new bride, Pragya.

Pre-wedding videos are not just a simple slide-show of images. Instead, they are choreographed, candid or concept-based videos that are designed to keep a public audience engaged. They are shot with the purpose to ask viewers to save the date for an upcoming wedding, or screen the couple’s love story at the wedding, or be an invite, according to Fahad Janvekar, partner, NJM Productions, a citybased production house.

“We have noticed a considerable rise in the interest for pre-wedding videos. During the wedding season, we get at least two people a month interested in shooting such videos,” he adds.

Usually timed between a minute or five, the cost of making such pre-wedding videos start from Rs 20, 000 and upwards. Prices vary from the length and the nature of a shoot. While a candid pre-wedding video could cost Rs 35,000 or more, a concept-based pre-wedding video would be around Rs 45,000 and upwards.

Wedding planner and founder of Chirmi Weddings, Bhumika Nahata, points out that while wedding videos are still an emerging trend, many millennial couples are willing to even travel a distance to get a perfect short film. “We’ve had couples who have travelled to Leh and Goa to shoot that perfect pre-wedding video. Themes vary from Bollywood to English music, depending on the taste of the couple. The aim is to have a movie-like feel to it all,” says Nahata.


Couple Sriram Ved and Yen Trinh, who got a pre-wedding video shoot done against the backdrop of a Bollywood theme, feel that doing so captured their quirks as a couple in a story telling way. “The pre wedding shoot was shot within six hours. Since our wedding was of mixed cultures, we used this Bollywoodbased film to showcase it at our reception in Vietnam. We were treated like movie stars and it felt like my dream of being in a Bollywood film actually came true,” says Trinh.

According to Raghav Anand, digital media segment champion, EY India, video audience in the millennial generation is slated to go up by CAGR 33% in the coming years. “Increase in bandwidth, mobile devices and dropping data rates have given a push forward to this audience. The population of 190 million millennials in the age group of 15-34, will rise to 420 million by 2021, leading to a rise in consumption in the segment,” he says."
437,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 11:22 AM IST",TNN,Politics,Even BJP MPs drag feet on PM scheme,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 02, 2018)
Only 19% of MPs have identified the three villages they are entitled to pick for the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAANJHI) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day 2014. The PM had appealed to every MP to develop three adarsh grams by March 2019. While 88% of MPs have picked at least one village, only 59% have picked a second. Interestingly, almost all Trinamool MPs have steered clear of the scheme.

Till date 1,314 villages have been identified where 42% of the work is completed. The rural development ministry has written to chief ministers and MPs asking them to identify villages and help to achieve the target set by the PM.

Interestingly, it is not only opposition MPs who have been sluggish in adopting the scheme. About 191 BJP Lok Sabha MPs are yet to identify their third village while 84 haven’t even picked their second village yet. Similarly, only 12 BJP Rajya Sabha members have picked three villages and 20 haven’t identified their second village so far. Almost all BJP MPs, however, have identified at least one village.


The scheme is overseen by the rural development minister. Atul Kumar Tiwari, joint secretary with the ministry, told TOI that the process of identifying villages is going on. He said many states have adopted a sequential practice of adoption, in which a third village is adopted only after significant work in the second phase. MPs are also trying to do more work in the first phase before adopting two more villages, he said.

Tiwari said the rural development minister has been writing to MPs. Some said they find it difficult to choose one village as it is not politically expedient to do so. According to the ministry, some states have shown less interest in the scheme pulling down the overall numbers. “The scheme must be evaluated on the basis of the overall change in paradigm it has brought in rural development,” said Tiwari.

PM launched the scheme on October 11, 2014 with a goal that each MP would develop three adarsh grams by March 2019, of which one would be achieved by 2016. Thereafter, five such adarsh grams (one per year) have be selected and developed by 2024. Lok Sabha MPs can choose a gram panchayat from their constituency while Rajya Sabha MPs can select a village from any district in the state from which they are elected. No special fund is allocated for the scheme and MPs are supposed to use their political capital to energise government schemes and utilise funds under these schemes."

A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar sought information on possible re-examination for the class 10 Maths paper after CBSE said it was still ascertaining the extent of the leak before announcing the date for the fresh test.

The court put the query to the secondary and higher secondary education regulator while issuing notices to the CBSE and the Centre seeking their stands on a plea for a court- monitored probe into the recent leaks of the Maths and Economics question papers of class 10 and 12, respectively.

During the brief hearing, the bench asked the CBSE as to how could it wait till July to re-conduct the test and keep the students on ""tenterhooks"" till then.

The court observed that it would not only waste an academic year of the students, but would also be akin to keeping ""a sword hanging over their heads.""

The CBSE said no decision has been taken regarding class 10 Maths re-examination as it was ascertaining if the leak was pan-India or confined to Delhi and Haryana alone.

The court subsequently asked the CBSE to take a decision on the issue and inform it by April 16, saying that even class 10 is crucial for the students as they decide on the basis of their results what streams of studies to take up for classes 11 and 12.

The CBSE has already decided to re-conduct the Class 12 Economics examination on April 25.

The PIL was mentioned today before the bench which had agreed to hear it.

The petition by NGO Social Jurist has sought that the class 10 Maths exam be held in April, instead of in July as proposed by the authorities.

The petition by advocate Ashok Agarwal has also prayed for a direction to the CBSE to award liberals marks to the students in the Maths and Economics re-examinations."

They are going to benefit significantly by investing in equities and today the scenario is such that you are going to make or create wealth. Equities continues to be the best investment avenue to create wealth. I am very optimistic given the economic conditions in India. The socioeconomic and political challenges are spreading negative vibes all around. Banking scams are happening, but everybody is forgetting the positive things that are happening today.

The markets have been in a downtrend where traders are losing money. It is very easy to forget the positives. When things are bad and the sentiment is bad, we look further down. On the other hand, when the market is going up, multi-baggers are created. There is a tendency to look further up. Let us be more rationale and realistic and optimistic. There are enough ingredients for that.

Absolutely and who better than you to rub off the optimism on players? There are notes coming in from brokerages this morning saying that they maintain their outperform on the ICICI stock and they believe that after the 22% damage in the last three months, ICICI Bank has become worth a buy. Is that a story that you are also tracking?

For all the noise around NCLT, IBC or the banking scams, there is a positive side as well. In India, we have always been accustomed to the old model of looting the public money. We are not a role based society, we are far behind. For the first time, there is something happening in this country: a crackdown on black money, the corruption and now we are seeing a major crackdown.

For the first time in this country, there is a crackdown on the nexus between corporates, the banks and the politicians. Why do not you see the positive of that? This indicates a brighter future for our financial and economic system.

Also Read: 10,000 new normal for Nifty; watch private banks for opportunity: Porinju

What is your favourite spot within financials?

Within finance, there is lot of things to look forward to in well managed private sector banks with a reasonable or low NPAs. Uday Kotak was talking about the private sector banks gaining up to 50% market share in the next few years’ time. It has a lot of implication on the private banks especially the well run, well managed private sector banks, the midcaps and even the large caps.

Investors can bet on some of them but not everything is that cheap. Some of them are still very fancily priced and a bit stretched in valuations. You have to find your stock within the sector. Regarding the public sector banks, I have no comments. There is still lot of grey areas and we do not know how far they will get hit. Amateur investors can avoid public sector banks at this point of time.

What is the opportunity in insurance as well as healthcare space?

Yes definitely. India is grossly underpenetrated in case of insurance whether it is life insurance or health insurance or other general insurances. Investors can go to the best of the large insurance companies for a reasonable compounding in the coming years like HDFC or ICICI.

However, very limited number of companies are available in that area. More importantly, the market is going to remain steady to positive going forward. That is where investors can really bet on.

Many of these negatives that you are talking about like the IBC or these banking scams, we need a clean-up at least once in the whole system. The values in the society has been declining in the last many decades.

Are you a buyer right now in the likes of an ICICI Bank or Fortis? Do you find value in these two names?

I have already given my view on the banking stocks. I do not think it is very important for people to look only at insurance and banking companies. There are a lot of great companies out there, especially the consumption theme of India is one where investors can make a lot of safe money.

As for banking stocks, I was just looking at IDFC Bank. The stock is priced at around Rs 48, maybe around Rs 16,000-crore market cap. Now that is getting merged with Capital First and it is going to be around Rs 22,000 crore market cap today. Mr Vaidyanathan is a very good leader and maybe under his leadership, this merged entity looks like a very safe bet.

I have no vested interest. I am not holding either in PMS or personally.

You also highlighted consumption. While the Street seems to be betting on a rural recovery, it is these urban plays which have held out. What do you like in consumption space?

Our great politicians in the last many decades have kept 50% of India’s population poor. They cannot consume as they do not have any resources. The other 50% can reasonably consume. That itself is a huge number and that is something that have been driving our economy, our market.

If we can progress and have more people with capability to consume much beyond the most basic daily needs, it is a long way for this country to go in consumption. I have been talking about many companies in the past -- Godrej Industries NSE -0.33 %, Tata Global Beverages NSE 0.26 %, Indian Hotels, even Godrej Agrovet, the recently listed company.

Some of these wonderful big themes have promoters with proven track record of wealth creation. The investors can always bet on such large companies with more clarity and visibility in the given consumption themes for the country. Some of the stocks which I mentioned we are still holding are Godrej Industries and Tata Global.

Even Indian Hotels is something we are holding. They all are very large businesses in such a huge country and if well managed, these companies can create beautiful wealth for the shareholders in the coming years. I am very optimistic in this country and in our economy. Despite the political challenges, despite the deterioration of values in our society, equity will continue to be one of the best investment avenue going forward."

444,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 11:41 AM IST",TNN,Politics,Difficulty of being CJI in the shadow of politics over removal,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 02, 2018)
Renowned lawyer and senior Congress MP Kapil Sibal last week accused the NDA government of “continuously assaulting the judiciary” while echoing Justice Jasti Chelameswar’s view that the Centre was “putting collegium recommendations on the back burner if the names are not to its liking”.

Sibal was quoted as saying in a media report, “They have first filled educational institutions with RSS pracharaks. Now, they are trying to infiltrate the judiciary with people having such mindset.”

A few weeks ago, Sibal had retorted to CJI Dipak Misra’s courtroom comment that he must read history by saying he was both a student and teacher of history. Sibal is well versed in the judiciary’s history too, we are sure. Probably, he needs to refresh his memory, especially because he is among the few in Congress strenuously pushing for moving a removal motion against CJI Misra in Parliament.

The January 12 press conference by senior SC judges led by Justice Chelameswar against the CJI had attracted magnetic support from Left leaders friendly to a rebel judge. The Congress, in the process of replacing old warhorses with prime stallions to keep the party chariot competitive for the derby of general elections, decided to cash in on the situation as many important cases, including politically usable Ayodhya and death of judge B H Loya, were being heard by a CJI-led bench.

Some Congress lawyer-MPs saw the opportunity to hit hard with a removal motion as the judiciary was red hot with an internal dissension fuelled by one person’s insatiable desire to wreak vengeance because he could not become CJI. Personal ambitions surely cause disturbances in the normal functioning of a system, be it judiciary or politics. And we surely don’t deny what Justice Chelameswar said in his March 21 letter, quoting Robert H Jackson, that “men are more often bribed by their loyalties and ambitions than by money”.

Attempts are on to get the draft motion signed by 50 Rajya Sabha MPs, the number required for moving it in Parliament. Before we refer to pages of judicial history to understand Sibal’s comment that the NDA government is trying to fill judiciary with “such mindset”, a discussion on the fallout of a removal motion against the CJI will help understand the gravity of the situation.

Today, the Congress with 54 MPs in RS may well be able to bring a removal motion against the CJI, howsoever frivolous or imaginary the charges may be. Tomorrow, the NDA, which too has more than 50 MPs in RS, could cook up some charge to bring a removal motion against the No.2 in the SC. Another party can start a campaign for a removal motion against the third in the SC hierarchy.

Where will it end? Which judge will willingly become CJI in such a dreadful scenario and risk his dignity and reputation? Worse, will this kind of political one-upmanship not force a judge to ensure political support before becoming CJI to counter threats of removal?

Bringing a removal motion against a CJI or a judge based on unverified charges has a numbing effect on the institution and stunts public faith in it. Lawyers become MPs not because they are great politicians. Success in court brings them money and fame, accelerating their rise in political parties. When they attempt to cow down the judiciary by casting a shadow through a phantom removal motion, it is akin to an assault on the very tree that nurtured their growth.

Unlike today’s Congress, led by a youthful president Rahul Gandhi, the party split in 1969 after a bitter war between veterans on one side and the young Turks on the other led by Indira Gandhi. The split reduced her government to a minority, but she continued as PM with support from Left parties. The landmark SC decision in Golaknath case in 1967 curtailing Congress government’s power to amend the Constitution and the political red nose caused by the 1970 Privy Purses judgment forced Indira to call mid-term polls.

A heady 352 seats in Lok Sabha in 1971 strengthened her resolve to infiltrate the SC with “committed judges”. The task was meticulously carried out by law minister H R Gokhale, the Bombay HC judge turned politician; steel and mines minister S Mohan Kumaramangalam, a barrister and earlier a prominent communist leader; and S S Ray, another barrister and a close confidant of Indira.

To overrule an 11-judge bench decision in the Golaknath case, the SC decided to set up a 13-judge bench for Kesavananda Bharati case. Eight SC judges were appointed just before the hearing in Kesavananda case began to ensure most of them found place in the 13-judge bench for a favourable ruling.

Justice P Jaganmohan Reddy in his book ‘We Have Republic’ wrote, “Of these eight, two were said to be Gokhale’s nominees (D G Palekar and Y V Chandrachud of Bombay HC); one of Kumaramangalam (K K Mathew of Kerala); two of Ray (S C Roy and A K Mukherjea) and two from the PM (M H Beg and S N Dwivedi); only one was CJI S M Sikri’s nominee (H R Khanna). One died before the case was heard. Of the seven who heard the case, five upheld the government’s point of view.

A legendary researcher on SC judges, George H Gadbois, wrote, “Seven of the nine Sikri era appointees were members of the Kesavananda bench, and five of these did support what can be considered the government’s wishes. But they were in the minority with A N Ray. Khanna, who cast the deciding vote, and Mukherjea joined the five pre-Sikri era court appointees in the majority.”

The 7-6 majority carved out the basic structure doctrine while fortifying and reinforcing Golaknath judgment much to the chagrin of Indira, whose government wreaked vengeance a day after the Kesavananda judgment was delivered on April 23, 1973, by announcing that A N Ray, fourth senior most SC judge, would be the new CJI to supersede K S Hegde, J M Shelat and A N Grover. The three resigned. The judiciary was to endure many painful wounds inflicted by Congress governments in the succeeding years. We will narrate those some other time. The above example is meant to refresh Sibal’s memory about “assault on judiciary”.

As a celebrated lawyer, Sibal should discharge his debt for the fame he has earned through the judiciary. He has ability, knowledge and craftsmanship to differentiate himself from hawkish politicians, whose feathers resemble those of Gokhale, Kumaramangalam and Ray. The choice is his."

449,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 12:10 PM IST",ETMarkets.com,Stocks,"If you want to make money in stocks, make friends with the millennials","Dial M for millennials -- the group is increasingly driving the show for India's consumption story. The good part is India Inc is taking note.

India is home to some 45 crore millennials, a good 35 per cent of its entire population. All the more reason why it's imperative to understand their lifestyle and consumption habits while drawing up a portfolio.

Millennials are those who are in the age group of 18-35 years.

Eating out, extensive travelling, catching up with friends or relatives online, looking for cracker of a deal on e-commerce sites, searching for start-up ideas and creating VLogs (video blogs) are a few characteristics that define today’s millennials.

The winds of change are already blowing. This set of buyers is all set to redefine the way India consumes products and services, with a growing chunk constituting the working age population (47 per cent). They save far less than their older counterparts and spend their disposable income on immediate gratifications, according to Elara Securities (India).

India Inc doesn't want to miss the bus. It's already on the job busy creating a portfolio more suitable for these millennials.

Ashni Biyani of Future Consumer in an interaction with ETNow said, “With Nilgiris, we believe there is a lot of traction that this brand has in the southern geography and now we are making it a millennial-friendly brand.”

Globally, millennials account for 27 per cent (190 crore) of the world’s 740 crore population, according to Hay Group. In India, they make up 35 per cent of the total populace and 23 per cent globally.

FMCG, e-commerce, smartphone manufacturers, auto, telecom, education, and services are some of the industries that are likely to benefit, given the spending behviour of these new-age consumers, say market experts.

“Millennials are getting into the formal financial sector more than ever before and the digital space is growing very rapidly although the is too low,” said Nirmal Jain, founder and Chairman of IIFL, at the just-concluded ETMarkets Global Summit 2018.

Elara Securities said millennials spend nearly 162 minutes per day online while watching TV and mostly surf the Internet searching through , checking up social media websites or looking for entertainment from videos. They spend 20 minutes per day on watching videos online.

Smartphone penetration is only going to fuel the trend. There are expectations that the penetration is expected to hit 50.1 crore by 2020, from 35 crore in 2017.

“E-commerce accounts for 1-2 per cent of sales for the FMCG industry and 1 per cent for Hindustan Unilever,” said Elara Securities in its report.

Consumption of packaged foods is also expected to grow as this younger lot has more cash than time. “Millennials are averse to processed foods categorically as seen in their purchasing behaviour in modern trade and e-commerce,” stated Elara.

Growing consciousness to look good and fit is also dictating the product portfolio. Four out of 10 girls, the report said, skip food to remain fit and slim. That explains why companies which are into the business of foods such as oats, organic milk, herbal and green tea, fresh vegetables, fruits and fruit juices stand to gain with the rising working population.

“Companies like Nestle, Hindustan Unilever and Marico are accelerating product launches to keep pace with millennials,” added Elara.

With more millennials and their improving disposable income, demand for health supplements, gadgets, apparel and grooming products is seen to gather traction further.

G Chokkalingam, founder, Equinomics Research and Advisory, said, “It is important to track millennials' lifestyle while creating a portfolio because their size has grown now. They are mostly consuming healthcare products in the FMCG sector, electronic products, ready-made garments as well as motorcycles. Overall, they mostly spend on discretionary products that they can afford.”"

A 60-metre-long bailey bridge on the Gangotri-Dharasu national highway, which connects Gangotri NSE -4.55 % with Uttarkashi district headquarters, collapsed for the second time within three months, cutting off accessibility to the shrine and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) outposts on the India-China border. A bailey bridge is a temporary bridge of lattice steel designed for rapid assembly.

According to witnesses, the bridge with a load capacity of 18 tonnes collapsed at 10:30 am on Sunday when a truck filled with sand was crossing it. The incident which occurred just over a fortnight before the Char Dham yatra begins on April 18 has left the district administration racing against time to prepare an alternate route so the yatra is not disrupted.

Thousands of pilgrims use the bridge daily to reach the Gangotri shrine during the yatra season. The bridge built at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore also provides connectivity between Uttarkashi town and 80 villages nearby.

Local residents Bhramanand Nautiyal and Chandra Mohan Bhatt told TOI, “The bridge collapsed when a truck loaded with sand was crossing over it. The truck fell down along with the bridge but the driver and the vehicle were unharmed. We had been fearing such an incident as many of us had noticed the bridge trembling often over the past few days due to continuous movement of heavy vehicles.”

District magistrate Ashish Chauhan has launched an inquiry into the incident. “A committee has been set up to investigate the cause of the accident. At present, our priority is to restore traffic by developing an alternate route,” Chauhan said."

Four minutes after executing the second orbit-raising operation, Indian Space Research Organisation’s (Isro) Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan lost all contact with GSAT-6A, a mega communication satellite that was to provide mobile communications to both civilians and the armed forces.

At 9.22 am on Friday, the first orbit raising operation changed the apogee and perigee height to 36,412 km and 5,054 km respectively. MCF gave the command to fire the LAM engine for the second orbit raising operation at 9.51 am on Saturday. The satellite executed it and the engine fired for 53 minutes and 54 seconds. Soon after, it communicated back, the signals riding electromagnetic waves and covering a distance of 36,000 km to reach the ground station within a fraction of a second. Then, all went blank.


On Sunday, TOI had reported that the satellite had experienced hitches in communication and Isro officially confirmed saying, “After the successful long duration firings, when the satellite was on course to normal operating configuration for the third and the final firing, scheduled for April 1, 2018, communication from the satellite was lost.”

Scientists and engineers at MCF continued working to establish contact with the satellite even as another team was trying to analyse the exact cause for the power failure. “With everything else having gone exactly as per our plans, we are confident that the systems are working well. At this moment, we do not know what caused the power system to fail,” one scientist said.

According to Isro chairman K Sivan, “when there are power fluctuations, the satellite goes into a safe mode with all communication lost. This is not unusual.” “However, that has not happened this time,” Sivan told TOI, adding Isro was “still hopeful of regaining control.”

Sivan said scientists were even trying to send non-command messages to see if the satellite responded. But the agency has not seen any success.

Y S Rajan, distinguished professor, Isro, said there have been instances of signals going blank. “Sometimes, it may suddenly wake up and sometimes it may not. It could also be an issue of a charge or a recharge (battery) problem. It will take at least two or three days depending on the anomaly. There have been instances of Nasa losing communication with its satellites and getting it back.”

But even as Isro scientists and engineers burned the midnight oil, insiders said the agency was likely to launch a massive quality assurance drive which might impact immediate future launches.

Given that this is a second major technical issue faced by the agency — a PSLV heat shield separation failure prevented navigation satellite IRNSS-1H from reaching the orbit in August 2017— in seven months, there will be a renewed emphasis on processes, an insider said.

454,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 01:36 PM IST",PTI,Sports,No dope shame but needles could land Indians in trouble at Commonwealth Games,"GOLD COAST: The Indian Commonwealth Games contingent could be in trouble amid speculation that its boxers possessed syringes in violation of the event's 'no needle policy' but the country is believed to have steered clear of any doping embarrassment.

Commonwealth Games Federation CEO David Grevemberg, in a press conference here, said the CGF has initiated an investigation into the matter but did not name India as the target of the probe.

Grevemberg said the CGF was in talks with the concerned Commonwealth Games Association amid spiralling speculation that Indian boxers are the ones under the scanner in this case. The Games are due to start April 5 after an opening ceremony on April 4.

""That CGA has now been summoned to engage in a meeting with our medical commission later today (Monday 2 April),"" Grevemberg said.

The Indian contingent has been insistent that there has been no wrongdoing on its part.

After claiming that the syringes found could have belonged to other teams who are staying in the same compound of the Games village, a top official today confirmed that the recovery was indeed made from an Indian but denied any dope violation.

""There has been no doping violation because the syringe had been used to inject multi-vitamins. The boxers have been tested and had there been a violation, we would have known by now,"" a top official in the Indian contingent told PTI.

""We are now waiting for what the CGF decides,"" he added.

The CGF CEO, meanwhile, said sanctions would be in order depending on the explanations put forth by the concerned unidentified Commonwealth Games Association.

""The report (of the medical commission) will include the testimony of the concerned CGA and that will be put forward to our federation court for further deliberation to determine the appropriate sanction.""

Games organising committee chairman Peter Beattie insisted that the matter would be dealt with transparently.

""There will be transparency and nothing will be covered up,"" he said.

The CGF 'no needle policy' prohibits the administration of injections without strong medical support. The policy is relaxed only for athletes requiring prescribed medication or nutritional supplements under the supervision of a medical practitioner.

However, the CGF insists that athletes should take prior permissions, failing which can result in unspecified sanctions."

Researchers led by the University of Exeter in the UK examined how climate change could affect the vulnerability of different countries to food insecurity - when people lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.

The study, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, looked at 122 developing and least-developed countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and South America.

""Climate change is expected to lead to more extremes of both heavy rainfall and drought, with different effects in different parts of the world,"" said Richard Betts, a professor at the University of Exeter.

""Such weather extremes can increase vulnerability to food insecurity,"" said Betts.

""Some change is already unavoidable, but if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, this vulnerability is projected to remain smaller than at 2 degrees Celsius in approximately 76 per cent of developing countries,"" he said.

Warming is expected to lead to wetter conditions on average - with floods putting food production at risk - but agriculture could also be harmed by more frequent and prolonged droughts in some areas, researchers said.

Wetter conditions are expected to have the biggest impact in South and East Asia, with the most extreme projections suggesting the flow of the River Ganges could more than double at 2 degrees Celsius global warming, they said.

The areas worst affected by droughts are expected to be southern Africa and South America - where flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25 per cent, according to the researchers.

Edited excerpts:


Post the notification from the Reserve Bankm the pressure has eased off on yields. Would you say you are in a better space right now?

These changes will bring more stability to banking industry. Those accounts which are not yet under resolution plan now, will come under resolution plan. Identification will be over and going forward, they will be addressed in a manner. The banking industry and all those companies would also benefit as per the resolution plan. The NCLT 1, NCLT 2 cases were identified long ago.

Once those accounts are resolved, definitely, NPA will come down, recovery will happen and those units again will start running and employment will be generated. So, economy will benefit. These are all good steps and the new guidelines will help identifying the weak accounts and going for the right kind of course corrections and resolution plan to help everybody.

The IBC amendments could also lead to reduction of COC voting cap for extending resolution period beyond 180 days to 66% versus the 75% now. Would this help with faster resolution?

This is the first time, that we are learning from our experiences and whatever we are learning, accordingly we are changing the rules and going for right kind of course corrections. It will definitely help as per our experiences. We have faced hurdles in the process. To quicken the process and go for right kind of value creations, all those changes are being proposed and it will definitely help the corporates, the bankers and everybody.

That indeed is the case but the interim finance norms are to be relaxed to boost stressed asset space. Do you think that would be helpful as well if the interim finance interest is to be calculated one year post liquidation date or repayment? How do you think this will help?

As per the mutual discussions and then consultation process, the committee has taken note of all the things that is required to help the unit. In the meantime, it goes to bidding process if required and then we can get more value. This is all as per the request by all the stakeholders. The committee has recommended it will be helpful.

What about regulatory dues? Will that not be counted as operational credit? Regulators cannot drag defaulters to bankruptcy code, is that the implication?

These are all at a discussion stage and all aspects will be examined and then they will take a right call. Right now, it is all under discussions. Let us wait for the final outcome.

There are certain reports which are indicating that banks have drawn a third list of NPAs to be referred to the NCLT under IBC’s third list. The third list contains about 25 to 30 companies where the total exposure of accounts is higher than Rs 2000 crore. Could you confirm what is the total amount of bank NPAs that could come under the third list?

As per the February 12th Reserve Bank of India guidelines, all those accounts with a limit of Rs 2000 crore and above, will be examined and if that is overdue, those accounts can be addressed. There should be initiative about all those things without waiting for an indefinite period. A time-bound resolution programme is going to happen and in the process, some of the accounts which are not viable or those who are not in a position to be revived may be referred to NCLT for quick resolutions. It is a good initiative and it will have time-bound impact where banking industry, economy, corporates, industry, everybody will help.

When would the third list of NPAs be drawn? and what would be the nature of NPAs or sectors that you could highlight that?

Third list, fourth list. It will continue. Accounts will be examined by all banks and there they will go for right kind of resolution of plan. If it is not going to be resolved then without waiting for indefinite period those accounts will be referred to NCLT and number of accounts will be examined case by case you never know what will be the final number but all those accounts will be examined closely very closely and they will look at all aspects then they will take a final call.

By how much do you see Bank of India NPAs provisions rise due to the recent RBI 12th February circular on NPAs?

The audit is going on. So, the exact number will not be appropriate to discuss in public today but definitely those accounts, which earlier were not identified, will be examined today and already the process has started. Our department is working on the number and we are following the RBI guidelines.

Some accounts will definitely be slipping, not only in Bank of India, but the entire banking industry accounts you are referring to, the 23-25-account strong third list will be examined. Bank of India will also examine some of the accounts and accordingly will take a final call but this will all depend upon the audit being over. In the meantime, Bank of India has recovered around Rs 7000-9000 crore from different NPA accounts which had downgraded earlier.

The final number would be decided after the audit but I feel that since we have recovered quite a good amount from those accounts in this quarter, it will be quite helpful for Bank of India.

How much exposure do you have to both the first and the second list of NCLT cases post recent bids? How much do you see being resolved especially when it comes to the exposure to the steel sector?

In NCLT, we have around Rs 8300 crore and the good news is that some of the big accounts which are going to be over by April end, we have already provided 100%. That will be seeing the reversal of provisions to profit and loss . This will reflect in next quarter’s results, when not only NPA will come down, the risk weighted asset will also come down. We will have more opportunities for improvement in asset quality."

The corresponding sales for FY 2016-17 was 3,50,496 units.

The company had set itself an annual target of 5 lakh for the FY 2017-18, the cumulative sales for the financial year, including exports, stood at 5,74,787 units, which was an increase of 36% over the last year.

Sajeev Rajasekharan, EVP, Suzuki Motorcycle India said, the company has taken the first step successfully towards the objective of achieving 10,00,000 unit sales in FY 2019-20. The onus in now on them to sustain the momentum generated by this growth and continue to scale higher peaks.

468,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 12:47 PM IST",PTI,Science,Chocolate production may be harming environment: Study,"London: Your favourite chocolates may be significantly harming the environment, say scientists who found that the UK chocolate industry produces about 2.1 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in a year.

A study, published in the journal Food Research International, looked at the carbon footprint of chocolate and its other environmental impacts.

Researchers from the University of Manchester in the UK assessed the impact of ingredients, manufacturing processes, packaging and waste.

The study estimates that the UK chocolate industry produces about 2.1 million tonnes of greenhouse gases a year.

This is equivalent to the annual emissions of the whole population of a city as large as Belfast.

It also found that it takes around 1,000 litres of water to produce just one chocolate bar.

On average, each person individually consumes about eight kilogramme of chocolate per year, researchers said.

They found the raw materials used to produce chocolate as well as the packaging are the major environmental hotspot.

The impact from the ingredients are mainly due to milk powder, cocoa derivatives, sugar and palm oil.

""Most of us love chocolate, but don't often think of what it takes to get from cocoa beans to the chocolate products we buy in the shop,"" said Adisa Azapagic, professor at the University of Manchester.

""Cocoa is cultivated around the equator in humid climate conditions, mainly in West Africa and Central and South America so it has to travel some distance before it makes it into the chocolate products we produce and consume in the UK,"" said Azapagic.

According to the International Cocoa Organisation the annual production of cocoa beans in 2016 was 4.25 million tonnes.

The worldwide sales of chocolate are estimated to be worth more than USD 101 billion.

Production of the milk powder used to make milk chocolates is very energy intensive. Dairy cows also produce significant green house gas emissions per litre of milk produced. All of this adds to the environmental impact of chocolate.

""We hope this work will help the chocolates industry to target the environmental hotspots in the supply chains and make chocolate products as sustainable as possible,"" said Azapagic"

The statement comes after top Indian Army officials told that the Indian troops have been deployed along the disputed Sino-India border in the Himalayan range to increase their patrolling at a tri-junction of India, China and Myanmar to prevent a repeat of a Doklam-like standoff.

Reacting to India's increased deployment of troops along the border, Zhao Gancheng, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, claimed that India's ""provocations"" on the border will ""destroy"" the foundation of mutual trust and undermine bilateral ties.

""India keeps enhancing its military deployment along the border because it has never believed the border region will become peaceful,"" Zhao was quoted as saying by the Global Times yesterday.

""India thinks that border conflicts with China will eventually happen,"" Zhao said.

""India's provocations will destroy mutual trust and aggravate the delicate regional situation,"" Zhao added.

The mutual military distrust will ultimately undermine Sino-Indian relations in all sectors including diplomacy, economy and cultural exchanges, he said.

The Indian officials said the tri-junction, located around 50km from Walong, the easternmost town of India near the Tibet region, is extremely important for India to help it maintain its dominance in the nearby mountain passes and other areas.

A senior Indian Army official said Chinese troops did not enter the tri-junction too frequently but had developed a road infrastructure near the area which could be advantageous for the mobilisation of army personnel.

Troops of India and China were previously locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Doklam from June 16 last year after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. The face-off ended on August 28.

The area in Doklam where China tried to construct a road is a disputed territory claimed by both China and Bhutan. India sent its troops to stop the Chinese construction activity, saying it could be a threat to its strategic interests in the region.

Since the Doklam standoff, India has deployed more troops and increased patrolling along the borders with China in the Tibetan region."

ICICI Bank pointed out that the board meeting is routine in nature.

""ICICI Bank's board meeting being held today is a pre-scheduled board meeting convened for review of cases which are before National Company Law Tribunal under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and other routine matters,"" the bank said in a BSE filing.

The CBI has also questioned few ICICI Bank officials as part of a preliminary enquiry to find if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank's issuance of Rs 3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012.

ICICI Bank's board, however, has reposed full faith in Kochhar."

Relatives of the deceased received the bodies with teary eyes.

As the aircraft carrying the coffins landed at the airport, an air of gloom descended as distraught families looked at the caskets.

Out of these, 27 belonged to Punjab while four hailed from Himachal Pradesh.

Punjab Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was also present at the airport.

Students and parents are advised not to rely on rumours. In the past, a number of hoax leaked papers have been floated. Inform CBSE helpline,"" School Education Secretary Anil Swarup said.

Amid a nationwide outrage over the CBSE paper leaks, the HRD ministry had yesterday suspended one board official and initiated a probe even as the Delhi Police's Crime Branch arrested three persons, including two teachers of a private school, for their alleged involvement in the leak of Class 12 economics paper.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had already issued public notices alerting about fake question papers of Hindi Elective, Sanskrit and Political Science, which were circulating on social media, saying they were indicating ""hoax leaks"".

The HRD Ministry had last week announced that the re-examination of the CBSE Class 12 economics paper would be held on April 25, while the Class 10 mathematics re-test, if required, would be conducted only for Delhi-NCR and Haryana in July.

489,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 03:59 PM IST",ETMarkets.com,Stocks,RBI in wait and watch mode: This MPC member may stand by 25 bps hike call,"NEW DELHI: The RBI Governor Urjit Patel-led monetary policy committee (MPC) may leave repo -- the short-term lending rate -- unchanged at 6 per cent in its first bimonthly policy review for this financial year on Thursday.

The policymakers are meeting on April 4-5.

All except Michael Debabrata Patra of the six-member panel are expected to go for status quo.

The central bank is seen to maintain its neutral stance even as it may suggest upside risks to inflation in the near future. Likely announcements on bond market liberalisation, RBI's view on fiscal conditions and the government's borrowing plan will be tracked keenly.

Data on inflation have been comforting of late. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation that the RBI considers for its policy decision trended down to 4.44 per cent in February. Similarly, wholesale price index-based inflation (WPI) eased to a seven-month low of 2.48 per cent.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) sees the March CPI print at 4.2 per cent and believes that inflation risks are proving to be overdone. But not all agree.

""We think RBI Executive Director Michael Patra will reiterate his 25 bps rate hike call. In the last MPC minutes, he indicated that in the near-term (up to mid-2018), inflation is likely to drift well above the target,"" UBS said. The brokerage is expecting a 5-1 vote in favour of status quo and an adoption of wait-and-watch approach by the RBI.

Patra is the only MPC member who called for a 25-basis point hike in the December policy review. One percentage point is 100 basis points.
Others

In the December policy meet, he talked of inflation staying well above the target up to mid-2018 due to elevated global crude prices, substantial increase in MSP, fiscal slippage and higher Customs duty.

He also made the point that an expected decline in inflation between July 2018 and March 2019 is largely statistical as the HRA effect wanes. ""The target is in the danger of getting out of reach and over the next few months, the upper tolerance band is under threat. This could seriously dent the credibility of the Committee’s commitment to the target,"" he had noted.

MPC member Ravindra Dholakia had said in his December statement that while base effect was going to be favorable over the next 3-4 months, oil price movements can create uncertainties and pose serious upside risks.

Earlier this week, brent crude had hit the $70 a barrel.

Minimum support prices (MSP) remain another source of concern. This year's Budget had pegged the procurement price for summer (kharif) crop at 1.5 times production costs.

UBS expects a higher MSP to add 40-60 bps to the headline CPI inflation. Global crude oil prices hardening further and the risk of populist spending in the run-up to the 2019 general election could undermine India's macro fundamentals, it cautioned.

The foreign brokerage expects the MPC to take the line that economic growth is gathering momentum but that the nascent recovery needs to be carefully nurtured and growth put on a sustainably higher path. It pegged an average CPI inflation of 4.7 per cent for FY19 as against 3.6 per cent anticipated for FY18.

BofA-ML, on the other hand, expects the RBI to acknowledge that the on-going peak off in inflation -- it sees March quarter inflation average at 4.6 per cent, 50 bps below its 5.1 per cent Q4FY18 estimate.

Meanwhile, the market will look for MPC’s reaction to the recent cut in the government borrowing programme, and its view on the fisc thereof, said Lakshmi Iyer, CIO- Debt & Head of Products at Kotak Mutual Fund. ""Though our view is that of status quo, it would be interesting to see MPC’s accompanying stance in the light of moderation in CPI and its reaction to the recent global developments,” she said.

""The RBI will likely announce further details on the bond market liberalisation. In October 2015, it had announced a 10-quarter plan to allow a linear increase in foreign holdings of Indian debt (at Rs 2 50 crore per quarter). With the plan maturing on March 31, markets will await guidance for the next phase of liberalisation. A Rs 300-400 crore/quarter increase could cause a further softening in bond yields, and lessen trade deficit deterioration concerns for the rupee,"" UBS note said."

He also dismissed the allegations as ""baseless"" that the NDA government was against the upliftment of the backward community.

""It is the moral responsibility of the political parties to ensure that no caste or communal violence takes place anywhere,"" Singh told reporters here.

The Supreme Court had on March 20 ""diluted"" the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, ruling that the government servants should not be arrested without prior sanction and private citizens, too, be arrested only after an inquiry under the law.

Opposing the verdict, several Dalit organisations called for a 'Bharat bandh' today.

Meanwhile, Congress president Rahul Gandhi slammed the RSS and the BJP for the plight of Dalits, and said that he saluted the ""brothers and sisters"" from the community who have hit the streets to demand protection of their rights from the Modi government.

Speaking to reporters outside parliament, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad noted, ""The Centre was not a party in the proceedings at all. And therefore, on behalf of the Ministry of Social Justice, a very comprehensive review has been filed (against the dilution of the SC/ST Act).

""And the Government of India with great respect does not agree with the reasoning given by the Supreme Court in the matter,"" he said."

""The law and order should not be disturbed by these protests. The government is serious towards the development and progress of dalits. I appeal to them not to disturb the law and order,"" Adityanath said.

""Both the Centre and the state government are dedicated to the welfare of the backward castes, the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes. If there is any issue, one can bring them to the notice of the government,"" he said.

There are reports of the violence in some western UP districts during the protests by dalits.

The Supreme Court on March 20 had banned automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Scheduled Castes (SC) and the Scheduled Tribes (ST) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, a legislation meant to protect the marginalised communities from abuse and discrimination.

Ruling that no arrest can be made under the Act without prior permission, the apex court had also held that a court can grant anticipatory bail if it, prima facie, finds the complaint is an abuse of the law, false, motivated and intended to blackmail or harass a person.

This was necessary, the court had said, to prevent the rampant misuse of the tough provisions of the law."

The move by Kejriwal comes as no surprise as he has already apologised to several others, who had filed defamation suits and complaints against him.

The joint application was mentioned before Justice Manmohan by advocates Manik Dogra and Anupam Srivastava, who appeared for Jaitley and Kejriwal, respectively.

The court agreed to list the matter for hearing before the appropriate bench tomorrow if no technical objection is raised by the registry.

Jaitley had in December 2015 filed a Rs 10 crore defamation suit against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders-- Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh and Deepak Bajpai.

They had alleged financial irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) when Jaitley was its president. The BJP leader had denied all these allegations.

He had also filed a separate Rs 10 crore defamation case against Kejriwal after his then lawyer, Ram Jethmalani, had used objectionable words against Jaitley during his cross-examination in the first suit.

According to the joint application, apart from Kejriwal, other AAP leaders -- Chadha, Singh, Ashutosh and Bajpai -- have ""unequivocally"" apologised for their statements against Jaitley in connection with irregularities in DDCA.

Vishwas has not yet tendered an apology and therefore, the proceedings shall continue against him.

Kejriwal also apologised for Jethmalani's use of objectionable words against Jaitley during his cross-examination.

On February 20, Kejriwal had concluded his cross-examination of Jaitley in the first defamation suit.

The proceedings in the cross-examination was termed by the high court as ""malicious"" and ""a sheer mockery"".

The cross examination of Jaitley by Kejriwal, which had begun in March 2017, ended on February 20 after more than 300 questions were put to the union minister over around 11 days.

The proceedings had also witnessed the high court raising serious objections against the manner in which questions were being put to the BJP leader."

500,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 02:16 PM IST",Bloomberg,Defence,Why America’s two best fighter jets can’t talk to each other,"By Justin Bachman

With the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II, the U.S. has fielded two of the world’s most sophisticated, maneuverable and stealthy fighter jets. They both function as airborne shepherds of America’s flock of older combat aircraft, using their state-of-the-art systems to communicate threats and targets on the ground and in the air.

Unfortunately, they have a difficult time communicating with each other.The F-22, originally designed as an air superiority fighter, dates to the mid-1980s and was created to dispense near-invisible lethality against Soviet targets before the enemy knew it was there. The plane’s requirements for maximum stealth extended to its communications systems, since they can betray an aircraft’s location. But budget considerations and initial optimism about a post-Cold War world cut short its production. In 2009, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates ended the program.

And that’s where the problem begins. Had the Air Force gotten all the F-22s it wanted—more than double the 183 or so it has—integration of its systems with another fleet of “fifth generation” fighters wouldn’t have been as critical. The F-22’s Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL) is a much older system than the Tactical Link 16 system used on the newer F-35. While the F-22’s IFDL protocol can receive data from the F-35 and other allied aircraft, such as the F-16 and Eurofighter Typhoon, it can’t transmit the vast array of situational data it collects.

In a recent story on the situation, Air Force Magazine likened U.S. combat communications among the various aircraft to “a kind of Tower of Babel.” And the necessary modifications haven’t been fast in coming. “There’s a lot of improvements that could have been done and should have been done 15 years ago,” said David Rockwell, a senior defense electronics analyst with Teal Group. “The Air Force postponed a lot of things for [the] F-22.”

Both the Raptor and Lightning II are known as “fifth-generation” aircraft because of their stealth, sensors and other capabilities. Jets such as the Air Forces’s F-15 and F-16 and the Navy’s F/A-18 are “fourth-generation.” Russia and China also are fielding and refining their fifth-generation fighters, the Su-57 and J-31, respectively.

The U.S. fifth-generation jets are adept at disseminating a more detailed view of the battle space to older aircraft, increasing the former’s “survivability” in combat. The F-35 fleet also has what’s called a multifunction advanced data link (MADL) to gather and share information with other F-35s. This fusion of sensor data—and the ability to distribute it with allied aircraft—allows the F-35 to serve as a “quarterback” during a conflict. “You hear it from the [F-15) Eagles and the Marine Corps,” said Billie Flynn, an F-35 test pilot at Lockheed Martin Corp., which also made the F-22. “We’re keeping our own forces much more engaged and boosting survivability.”

“The thing that’s great about having Link 16 and MADL onboard and the sensor fusion is the amount of situational awareness the pilot has,” Lt. Col. George Watkins, a squadron commander, said in an Air Force statement last year. “I can see the whole war, and where all the other players are, from a god’s-eye view. That makes me a lot more effective.”

“We don’t have data anymore,” said Flynn, a former squadron commander for the Royal Canadian Air Force. “We have knowledge.”

When it comes to talking to each other, however, the F-22 and F-35 pilots currently must use secure voice links. This temporary fix has worked in training and simulated combat, Flynn said.

Keeping the F-22 relevant has been a 15-year effort. The Air Force established a modernization program in 2003, with 10 unique upgrades and enhancements. To date, the program has awarded contracts totaling as much as $12.9 billion, according to a Defense Department Inspector General audit on F-22 modernization released last month. The IG criticized the Air Force’s software development and contracting strategies.

“We’re always working on ways to improve connectivity wherever the mission requires additional information sharing,” an Air Force spokesman, Major Ken Scholz, said in an email. “As well, the F-35A and F-22 are very complementary assets, particularly in highly contested areas.”

Still, the Air Force doesn’t plan to fix the communications problem until 2023, when the F-22 fleet is scheduled to get the same Tac Link 16 system F-35s currently have.

While these two fighters have a ways to go until they share the same communications and sensor systems, there’s at least one thing they already have in common: they’re budget busters. The Raptor is the most expensive aircraft in the U.S. arsenal, in terms of cost per flight hour; the program ended up costing taxpayers more than $330 million per unit.

Operating and maintenance costs have grown daunting for the F-35 as well. The Air Force may need to cut almost 600 from its planned order of 1,763 if upkeep costs can’t be lowered by more than a third. It also faces annual maintenance costs of almost $4 billion for a fighter fleet that’s likely to top $1 trillion in sustainment through 2070 across the three service branches.

Meanwhile, Lockheed and others are working on near-term fixes for the F-22’s communications problems. Longer term, the Air Force would like to find a way to extend the existing stealth profile to its upgraded communications and radar systems, Rockwell said. “There could already be a partial classified solution in the short-term,” he said. “This is exactly the sort of thing that goes classified because you don’t want to put out that the F-22 can interact with other things.”"

NRC authorities sent around 5.72 lakh documents for verification across the country and has received 1.75 lakh verified documents so far.

The Supreme Court, which is monitoring the process of updation of NRC, has directed the chief secretaries of states to cooperate in the process.

The family tree is a vital component of the NRC updation process and will weed out fake legacy claims. The genuineness of a claim of a person lies on his/her belonging to the same ancestor.

NRC state coordinator Prateek Hajela told ET, “For us the family tree model is to gain accuracy. This is the model through which a person establishes link with ancestor. In case of doubts, those calming to be descendants of an ancestor are called for verification.”

A senior officer associated with NRC process said, “We are unearthing several fake claims in the family tree verification process. There are instances where individuals with a fake ancestor have a Pan Card and are enrolled in the voters' list.”

From April 2 onwards, the verification of certificates issued by the Gram Panchayat Secretaries will begin. The Supreme Court has upheld the legality of such certificates after the Guawahati High Court ruled against them saying these had “no statutory sanctity”.

The NRC updation process makes it mandatory for the Circle Officer/Gram panchayat Secretary to issue a certificate for women migrating after marriage. In the ongoing updation porcess, around 29 lakh have submitted panchayat certificates to act as a document of proof for their citizenship.

The Supreme Court, in its March 27 order, issued directions to state authorities to make all arrangements related to the publishing of the draft NRC by June 30. The court will hear the matter next on May 8 and take stock of the progress made in the updation process.

As per the apex cort, the updated NRC should have names of all Indian citizens, including their children and descendants, who have moved to Assam after March 24, 1971. In order to be included, individuals need to provide/share residential proof, even of they are based outside Assam, as on March 24, 1971.

The NRC is aimed at identifying the number of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Application were invited in 2015. Around 3.29 crore Assamese people had applied for inclusion and around 6.6 crore documents were submitted by the applicants.

The first draft was published on December 31, 2017.

The exercise involves 45,000 government officials, 8000 workers on contractual basis and 10, 000 to 15,000 people associating with NRC process at various levels."

While the Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the day within about six minutes after it assembled in the morning, the Lok Sabha was adjourned due to the protests for the first time till noon within four minutes after it had met and then for the day after the listed papers were laid.

Before adjourning the Lok Sabha for the day, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said she was unable to take up the notices for no-confidence motion against the government, served by several opposition parties, as there was no order in the House.

In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition protests forced the adjournment of proceedings for the day without transaction of any business as members trooped into the Well and shouted slogans, drowning every other voice.

MPs belonging to the Congress, Trinamool Congress, BSP, TDP and parties from Tamil Nadu -- DMK and AIADMK, were in the Well even before Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu could settle down in his chair.

Unlike the past days when listed papers were allowed to be laid on the table peacefully, Naidu had to go through the exercise today amid chaos as members persisted with slogan shouting.

The Congress and the BSP led the charge against the government, accusing it of being ""anti-dalit"", in an apparent reference to the Supreme Court ruling on the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Members of the main opposition party also raised the issue of India's biggest bank fraud, alongside the TMC.

Tamil parties were demanding immediate constitution of the Cauvery Water Management Board for division of river water between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, while members of the TDP and KVP Ramachandra Rao of the Congress held placards demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh.

Amid the din, Naidu called the ministers to lay the listed papers, while warning the protesters that ""the entire country is watching ... You are not going to achieve anything. You are making a mockery of parliamentary system."" He said the Chair was ready to allow discussion on all the issues being raised by opposition parties, and even the government as well as the opposition were ready for it.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said important bills were listed for discussion in the last week of the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament. The government, he said, was ready to discuss all issues. ""I don't understand why, for small issues concerning them, they are not allowing the House to function,"" Goel said.

However, as the ruckus continued, the Chairman adjourned the proceedings for the day, barely six minutes after the House had assembled.

The proceedings in the Lok Sabha were disrupted yet again for the 18th day today, amid slogan shouting by AIADMK members seeking early constitution of the Cauvery water management board. Amid the din, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the House till 12 noon during the Question Hour.

As soon as the House met for the day and took up the Question Hour, AIADMK members rushed into the Well shouting slogans such as 'we want justice' and 'we demand Cauvery board'. Citing assembly polls in Karnataka, the Centre has sought more time from the Supreme Court last week to set up the board to implement water sharing formula between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry.

While the TMC members were seated in their places, those of the TDP, which has moved a notice of no confidence against the government, were standing at their seats with black ribbons pinned to their shirts as a mark of protest.

As the ruckus continued, the Speaker adjourned the House till noon, barely four minutes after it had met after a long weekend.

Even before the House was re-assembled at noon, the AIADMK members, carrying placards, trooped into the Well shouting slogans.

Congress, NCP, Left, TDP and RJD members were standing in their seats seeking the Speaker's ruling on the notices they had given on the no-confidence motion, moved by some of them.

The Speaker appealed to the AIADMK members to return to their seats saying she cannot take up the no-confidence motion unless the House is in order.

""I am duty bound to place the no-confidence motion. But this is not the way. Please go to your seats. I am not in a position to count,"" she said. A notice of no-confidence can be taken up in the House if it is supported by at least 50 members present, for which a headcount is needed.

Parliamentary Minister Ananth Kumar also said the government was ready for discussion and give reply to the no-confidence motion but there has to be complete harmony in the House.

Leader of the Congress in the House Mallikarjun Kharge, who has also submitted a notice for no-confidence motion, said the opposition wanted to discuss a host of issues, including the recent Supreme Court ruling on SC/ST Act and alleged paper leak of the CBSE examinations.

However, as the AIADMK members continued raising slogans, the Speaker adjourned the House for the day."

The issue also rocked the state Assembly, which was adjourned till lunch break within minutes of commencement of proceedings.

MLAs from the opposition parties as well as some from the ruling side, demanded that a resolution be passed by the House urging the Centre to take adequate measures to undo the recent Supreme Court order on arrests under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

As soon as Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary took the chair, deputy leader of the ruling JD(U) Shyam Rajak rose to say, The SC/ST Act was aimed at preventing atrocities against the vulnerable sections of the society. Dilution of this Act by the Supreme Court has scared the affected communities .

Rajak suggested that a resolution be passed urging the parliament to make the Act unassailable by placing it in the 9th schedule of the constitution.

He added that the review petition filed by the Centre was just an ""eyewash"" and that such patchwork was not going to protect the interests of the SCs/STs.

Opposition RJD MLAs also raised an uproar on the matter in the House. Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said the state Assembly must stand in solidarity with the organisers of the Bharat Bandh.

""This House should pass a resolution urging the Centre to bring an ordinance that could provide an immediate relief to the affected social groups, he said.

As the bedlam erupted again, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm.

Meanwhile, large-scale protests were witnessed in various parts of the state as part of the Bharat Bandh.

According to police sources, the bandh supporters stormed the Patna Junction where they forced closure of ticket booking counters and squatted on railway tracks, disrupting movement of a number of trains.

In Bhikhna Pahari locality of Patna, students came to blows with bandh supporters when the latter forced closure of numerous coaching institutes located in the area.

Reports of rail traffic disruption also came from districts like Darbhanga, Gaya, Jehanabad, Begusarai, Bhojpur and Araria.

Long queues of vehicles, stranded on account of road blockade at various spots, were seen on national and state highways.

In Darbhanga, bandh supporters stormed the premises of a local court and indulged in vandalism. Glass panes of a showroom were smashed by the agitators in Gopalganj.

The protests in Purnea were notable on account of large-scale participation of women.

Bandh supporters also beat up locals in Nawada, vandalised vehicle of a Block Development Officer at Mokama in rural Patna and clashed with the police in Rohtas.

In most instances, the agitators were seen carrying blue flags bearing the names of Bhim Sena. Some of the mainstream political parties in the state like the RJD and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha have also announced support to the shut-down."

Vehicular movement was affected in several areas including Jharsuguda, Sundargarh, Malkangiri, Sambalpur and other tribal-dominated districts, police said. Buses also remained off the roads in Biramitrapur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Bolangir.

Shops and business establishments remained shut in several areas of tribal-dominated Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Sundargarh and Balangir districts in response to the 'Bharat bandh' call, they said.

Activists of 'Adivasi Dalit Sena' staged a rail roko at Khetrajpur station in Sambalpur which delayed some trains, they said.

The Adhikar Surakhya Manch, the Adivasi Mulabasi Bancaho Manch and the JMM have extended their support to the bandh call.

In the state capital, activists of different Dalit organisations put up road blockade near Vani Vihar, Jayadev Vihar and Acharya Vihar areas.

Several Dalit organisations have given a call for a 'Bharat Bandh' to voice their concerns over ""dilution"" of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act."
508,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 02:39 PM IST",PTI,Banking/Finance,"Crisil: NPAs to peak mid-way in FY19, muted credit pick-up","Even though the banks will see their dud assets piles peaking, rating agency Crisil NSE 0.74 % today warned that the ongoing probes into the frauds and allegations of improprieties against bankers will dent credit growth in the new fiscal year.

The massive revision of bad loan resolution norms announced on February 12 will lead to a spike in impaired assets in the March 2018 numbers, but will peak by mid 2018-19 and will gradually slide down, Crisil said and described FY19 as a ""year of reckoning"" for banking system.

The agency expects gross NPAs to shoot up to up to 11 per cent in the March quarter from 9.4 per cent a year ago, and inch up further to hit a peak of 11.5 per cent during the fiscal but will slip to 10.3 per cent in March 2019, senior director Somasekhar Vemuri told reporters over a concall.

He said once NPA worries are over, focus will return to core activities of credit growth and operational profit but seemed to suggest that the ongoing frauds like the nearly Rs 12,900-crore Nirav Modi scam and allegations of quid pro-quo at ICICI Bank NSE -0.26 % could play a dampener.

""These frauds could play a part in bringing credit growth down,"" he said, when asked about the impact of frauds and investigations on the banking system.

He said a possible impact from the same has been factored-in in the 11 per cent banking system credit growth estimate for FY19 versus 10 per cent it is likely to close FY18 with, and added that corporate credit growth will not be ""very high"" as they will continue largely to depend on working capital loans.

In FY19, the agency expects corporate loans to grow 5.5 per cent, retail credit to grow 20 per cent, agriculture by 15 per cent and small and medium enterprises by up to 10 per cent.

The agency expects net profit of state-run lenders to continue being ""suppressed"" due to high provisioning which will be required for the high quantum of the bad loans.

Terming FY19 as a ""year of reckoning"" for the banking system, where the over 5-year problem of NPAs is likely to peak, the agency said credit growth, exports growth, corporate leverage and the stressed asset resolution as the key monitorables.

The RBI's efforts to weed out troublesome assets to ensure that balance-sheets of lenders present a true picture through the one-time asset quality review, followed up with closer reviews that led to discovery of 'divergences' have led to the quantum of stress in the books being very high.

After the passage of the insolvency and bankruptcy code and the ongoing resolution of select accounts with high quantum of stress, the RBI overhauled its NPA resolution mechanism on February 12 making it mandatory for banks to classify assets as non-performing if they fail to pay up and also removed all the existing recast schemes, making initiation of insolvency proceedings mandatory.

It can be noted that apart from the scam at Punjab National Bank NSE -0.41 %, a host of other frauds have been detected at state-run lenders over the past two months like the over Rs 3,500-crore Rotomac fraud.

Private sector banks also are mired in allegations, starting with the largest one ICICI Bank, where the CBI has reportedly started a preliminary enquiry into a possible quid pro quo in which bank chief Chanda Kochhar's close family members have been alleged to be beneficiaries."

510,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 02:42 PM IST",,Science,Ganges flow could double at 2 degrees C global warming,"London, April 2 (IANS) Examining how climate change could raise food insecurity risk across the world, researchers have projected that the flow of the Ganges river could more than double at 2 degrees Celsius global warming, with floods putting food production at risk in countries like India.

""Climate change is expected to lead to more extremes of both heavy rainfall and drought, with different effects in different parts of the world,"" said study co-author Richard Betts, Professor at the University of Exeter in Britain.

""Such weather extremes can increase vulnerability to food insecurity,"" Betts added.

The study looked at the difference between global warming of 1.5 degree Celsius and 2 degree Celsius (compared to pre-industrial levels).

The findings, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, showed that despite increased vulnerability to food insecurity in both scenarios - the effects would be worse for most countries at 2 degrees Celsius.

""Some change is already unavoidable, but if global warming is limited to 1.5 degree Celsius, this vulnerability is projected to remain smaller than at 2 degrees Celsius in approximately 76 per cent of developing countries,"" Betts added.

Using a new global model based on patterns of sea-surface temperatures and sea ice, the researchers looked at 122 developing and least-developed countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and South America.

The researchers examined projected changes in weather extremes and their implications for freshwater availability and vulnerability to food insecurity.

They found that warming was expected to lead to wetter conditions on average -- with floods putting food production at risk -- but agriculture could also be harmed by more frequent and prolonged droughts in some areas.

Wetter conditions were expected to have the biggest impact in South and East Asia and the areas worst affected by droughts were expected to be southern Africa and South America - where flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25 per cent, the findings showed.

511,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 02:46 PM IST",PTI,Defence,"10 of 13 killed in offensive from Shopian, sign of security forces' control on area","Ten of the 13 militants killed over the weekend in a major offensive by the state police were from Shopian, an indication that security personnel have tightened their hold on the south Kashmir terror bastion over the last five months, officials said.

Most of the 10 from Shopian, once considered the ground zero of terrorism, were young and had joined the militant movement between last year and now. Sources in the security establishment expressed the hope that parents of disappeared youth would now encourage their children to shun violence and surrender.

The oldest of the 10 was Ishfaq Ahmad Thoker, alias 'Abrar', who became a militant in September 2015, officials said.

The others, from various villages in the district, were Ubaid Shafi Malla alias 'Abu Huraira', who became a militant in February 2017, Zubair Ahmed Turrey alias 'Abu Bakar', Nazim Ahmad Dar alias 'Furqan Bhai' and Rayees Ahmad Thoker (May 2017), Yawar Itoo (July 2017), Adil Ahmed Thoker (November 2017), Ishfaq Ahmed Malik alias 'Umar Bhai' (January 2018), Aetimad Hussain Malik (November 2017) and Sameer Ahmed Lone (February 2018).

Director General of Police S P Vaid made a passionate appeal, asking youth to shun violence.

""It is painful to all of us to see the loss of young lives. My appeal again to the parents of the boys, who have taken the wrong path... they should convince their wards to leave the path of violence and come home,"" he said yesterday.

Considered a gateway to the Kashmir Valley for being strategically located on the way to the historical Mughal road, Shopian had nearly 30 active militants, including Saddam Paddar and Zeenat-ul-Islam who are rated A++ category militants and carry a cash reward on them. Both are still at large.

The area, south of the Peer Panjal mountain range, can provide free access to terrorists to cross over to Doda, Kishtawar and Poonch area of Jammu, the officials said.

""My appeal to the young people of Kashmir would be not to be carried away by Pakistan or their proxies and be led into the path of violence,"" said Lt Gen A K Bhatt, corps commander of the Srinagar-based XV corps.

""We will carry out operations as we have carried against anybody who will use his weapon,"" Bhatt had said yesterday.

More than 50 youths from the area ""disappeared"", a euphemism for joining various militant groups, after the killing of Burhan Wani, the poster boy of Hizbul Mujahideen, on July 8, 2016.

The police, CRPG and the Army increased their footprint over Shopian, where militants roamed freely, last year.

The forceful resistance to security forces to enter into Heff Shermaal area in the district in April last year was an eye-opener, officials said. Security forces were compelled to withdraw, pushing senior officials to the drawing board to draft a new strategy to make Shopian a militant free zone.

Victor Force, a counter-insurgency unit of the Army headed by Major Gen B S Raju, Inspector General of Police (Kashmir range) S P Pani, along with senior CRPF officers brain-stormed and re-calibrated their plans to control Shopian, it is learnt.

Soon, intelligence information from locals started flowing, resulting in encounters that saw the top militant leadership, including the main recruiter for Hizbul Mujahideen Ifan Maldera and the group's financier Waseem Sheikh, being eliminated last year.

In November last year, the CRPF moved in a reserve battalion comprising nearly 1,000 men into Shopian. At the same time, police moved in a large number of its personnel to various parts of the district. Its crack teams joined hands with the Army and the CRPF.

The Army also established new camps at Nagabal, Chillipura, Maitribugh, Zainpura and Larkipura and increased its strength in existing camps in the area, the officials said.

The most important of these was the Army camp at Chillipura, which is located next to Heff Shreemal area.

Security forces yesterday gunned down 13 militants, including those responsible for the brutal killing of Lieutenant Umar Fayaz, in three counter-insurgency operations that also claimed the lives of three Army jawans and four civilians in Anantnag and Shopian districts.

The operations, which dealt a severe blow to terror groups in Kashmir Valley, were launched in the two districts Saturday night and continued till late Sunday. PTI SKL"

ET Now: Sandhar Technologies NSE -0.79 % got a fairly decent response, but are you satisfied with it?

 »
ET Now: How much of the money that you have raised from the IPO will flow into your books and how do you plan to use the proceeds going ahead?

Jayant Davar: The fresh issue will bring in Rs 300 crore. We currently have an overall debt of about Rs 500 crore, out of which Rs 250 crore is the working capital. Most of our working capital is for our overseas operations. We will retain this because it comes at a cheaper rate of interest. However, the term loan, which is about Rs 250 crore, will be completely extinguished by the proceeds that we have received.

ET Now: Your revenues have grown at a CAGR of about 9% over the last four to five years and margins at a CAGR of close to 8%, which is quite low if you compare it to some of your peers. Do you plan to scale up your sales and profitability going ahead? What exactly will be the key trigger for this kind of growth?

Jayant Davar: The last five years were sort of an investment phase for us, where we invested around Rs 650 crore into the business and they were all directed towards future technologies that were anticipated especially in terms of government mandates, whether they be safety norms or emission norms. Our Euro VI norms will plug in from 1st of April 2020. We wanted to use that as an opportunity to invest. We invested money in auto electronics. We are aware of 2019 mandates. Now that the investment phase is over, a lot of the margins that were under stress, on account of these investments and capital expenditures, will begin to reflect on the revenue side. The first six months of the financial year 2018 have seen margins go up by 120 bps with revenue rising by more than 22%. We expect that this is the beginning of that growth momentum and with the investments now getting on to the revenue phase we expect things to move much faster.

ET Now: There is word in the market that you are looking to diversify your offerings. What are the segments you are looking at in terms of future expansion? How do you plan to translate the strong demand in numbers especially this fiscal onward now that you are a listed company?

Jayant Davar: The one segment that we are thinking of diversifying into is the fuel pumps. All 30 million vehicles on the road will have to concur to the new emission norm, which means that all of them would need new fuel pumps. Now that market itself is huge, there could be several other people in the industry who are striving to be there. For each one of these new players there are huge opportunities that will add a large amount of revenue to their top lines. At this point of time the auto industry is doing well. The government has been very proactive in bringing out reforms. Their focus is on the rural, agricultural sectors and infrastructure. Sandhar plays into all of these areas, whether they are commercial vehicles or construction equipment, two wheelers, motorcycles or tractors. At this point of time everything does seem to be on the right path.

ET Now: You have a high dependence on two-wheeler segment which contributes almost 58% to your revenues. Your top five customers have about 70% of your overall revenues which is another factor that seems to be a bit worrying for market participants. Do you see any changes in your revenue given the increased focus on other segments and your talks about expanding customer base?

Jayant Davar: Honestly, we don't care where the revenue is coming from. We have built technologies that can be used across the auto sector -- two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, tractors, or commercial vehicles. When we started out 30 years ago, we were only supplying to two-wheelers. Today we have a diversified platform but two-wheelers still remain the largest segment because the volumes are much higher in this space. Take fuel pump for instance. The fuel pump costing would not be that different for four-wheelers or two-wheelers but two-wheelers obviously would bring us higher revenue because of sheer volume. We are not saying we are not diversifying. But at this point of time we are more into two-wheelers than in the other spaces."

While some states ordered closure of educational institutions and curtailed communication and transport services, including rail, incidents of arson and vandalism were reported from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Utar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab, among other states.

Curfew was imposed in Morena, Gwalior and Bhind districts of Madhya Pradesh after a student leader died in firing and several others were injured.

The Army was called in Bhind district, where six people were injured in firing by protesters, to control the situation, Bhind Superintendent of Police Prashant Khare said.

The Army and paramilitary forces have been asked to be on standby as a precautionary measure in Punjab.

A student leader, identified as Rahul Pathak, died in firing in MP's Morena district, Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Umesh Shukla told .

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh appealed for peace, while Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government was not a party to the Supreme Court decision on the SC/ST Act and ""respectfully"" did not agree with its reasoning behind the verdict.

Prasad also said the government has filed a very comprehensive review petition in the matter.

Union Minister Ramvilas Paswan, a prominent Dalit leader and head of NDA ally LJP, appreciated the government's quick decision to file the petition and accused Congress of having done nothing for Baba Saheb Ambedkar.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath appealed for peace and urged the people not to vitiate law order, as violence was reported from many districts including Azamgarh where protesters torched two state-run buses, injuring several passengers.

Protests turned violent in Agra, Hapur, Meerut in western UP.

Director General of Police (DGP), OP Singh, said the situation is under control in Agra, Sambhal and Hapur and that anti-riot police have been deployed there.

""We have sought more force from the Centre that will be deployed there. We are keeping an eye on the situation, which is under control,"" he said.

Many trains, such as Saptakranti Express, Utkal Express and the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani as well as the Kanpur Shatabdi, were stopped ahead of Ghaziabad in Meerut and Modinagar, officials said.

A group of about 2,000 people disrupted trains at the Hapur station as well, disrupting the movement of many goods trains, they added.

Protests were also witnessed at Ambala and Rohtak in Haryana as well as in Chandigarh.

The CBSE has already postponed Class 12 and Class 10 examinations scheduled to be held today in Punjab at the request of the state government in view of the 'Bharat Bandh'.

In the national capital region, protesters squatted on tracks at several places, stopping trains, including the Dehradun Express and the Ranchi Rajdhani, while a Northern Railway official said services were also disrupted by a mob in Ghaziabad.

The protesters gathered at Mandi House in Delhi and blocked the road outside the metro station there, bringing traffic to a halt and inconveniencing commuters travelling towards ITO and other stretches.

Heavy police force was deployed at Mandi House in view of the protests.

Shouting slogans of 'Jai Bhim', the protesters also blocked one of the carriageways of Barakhamba Road affecting traffic on the stretch, police said.

The Supreme Court had on March 20 diluted certain provisions of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, in a bid to protect 'honest' public servants discharging bona fide duties from being blackmailed with false cases under the Act.

The verdict is being widely criticised by the Dalits and the Opposition who claim that the dilution of the Act will lead to more discrimination and crimes against the backward community.

Nearly 30 people- 20 from Ajmer and 10 from Jaipur -- were detained in Rajasthan as protesters blocked rail and road traffic and vandalised public property, including a train, in many parts of the state. Protestors damaged glass windows of Shatabdi Express at Khairthal railway station, Khairthal GRP SHO Ramesh Chandra said.

According to Railways spokesperson, movement of seven trains was affected in North-Western railway region.

In Patna, MLAs from the opposition parties, as well as some from the ruling side, demanded a resolution be passed by the House urging the Centre to take adequate measures to undo the recent Supreme Court order on arrests under the SC/ST Act.

Protesters stormed the Patna Junction where they forced closure of the ticket booking counters and squatted on railway tracks disrupting movement of a number of trains.

Normal life was partially affected in several parts of Odisha as well after activists of 'Adivasi Dalit Sena' staged a rail roko at Khetrajpur station in Sambalpur which caused delay in the running of some trains, officials said.

In the state capital of Bhubaneswar, activists of different Dalit organisations put up road blockade near Vani Vihar, Jayadev Vihar and Acharya Vihar areas."

Well it is unfortunate that these iconic names in the private sector banking space have got entangled in this controversy, Of course, there is a lot of pressure on RBI now to show that it is doing something.

Now that the pressure is on the RBI, it has done something in respect of Axis Bank at least, that is what the report says today. I guess they have to be seen doing something on ICICI Bank as well. Now the unfortunate part is this sort of puts a cloud on the entire banking system. Fortunately, the ICICI Bank board has given a very clean chit to the management but nevertheless when this controversy comes up, it shakes confidence of both depositors, investors and lenders in the banking system. This cannot be good for the banking system. So, the banks will have to improve their self regulation, self governance, board procedures and systems to bring back the confidence of investors.

My first question was about the entire private banking space, but specifically for ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. How do you see the road forward for these two names? ICICI and Axis for quarters gone by, have been dealing with an asset quality problem?

The fear of the quality of the assets becoming more transparent and therefore possibly affecting the profit and loss account of these two banks is going to be very real in the minds of investors. It will be a bold investor who would want to invest in this at this price and there will be people who will say better be safe than sorry. They will be dumping the stock. That is what I think we will see as basic reaction. People will say let us avoid this controversy. There are other opportunities in the market.

Opportunities would be outside banks. Banks constitute a major chunk when it comes the weightage on the index and it seems really as a proxy to economic growth. So where do you go outside of it?

Instead of relying on the proxy, you go directly into individual sectors. Those who want to stay in the market will do that but people will be also questioning whether the market as a whole will give them the kind of returns that they got in the last two years or whether it is now active stock picking time because with the clouds of uncertainty on election front and the politics being uncertain and oil prices at $70, there are some grey areas for investors to ponder over.

Is it then time to jump in because there are still those uncertainties as we kickstart a new financial year? You do not know how the GST collections are going to pan out. Inflation definitely is threatened as crude prices trot around $70 per barrel. Plus, the run-up to the 2019 elections and the big fear in the market that SIP run rate is going to get challenged.

The trend for the market as a whole cannot be upward. There has to be a pressure downwards but within that because India has a large number of listed scripts, there is an opportunity to pick winners where fundamental value is visible.

Last month for instance, stocks have been dumped especially in the midcaps and the smaller cap space. If one closely examines the management and the company and the products, quality is available at reasonable prices or at least emerging. We can see that there will be opportunities for buying. It will not be large investments in a single script that will take place. It will be smaller size investment and you may have to look at little further in terms of the midcap space to invest.

In large-cap space, because there is a lot of index buying, many of these scripts automatically get investments coming in and they do not fall as much when such shakeup or such uncertainties arise. But the smaller midcap scrips do offer opportunity and this is where active management, active search, active research will pay handsome rewards to investors.

That is encouraging to hear. How are you mapping the trend when it comes to the auto sales? Hero actually has done well.

Auto sales have done very well. It is not just auto sales. In the last two years, we had relatively decent monsoons though last year’s monsoon is a bit erratic and there was pent up demand because demonetisation affected the purchasing side of demand and the GST implementation caused a bit of flutter on the supply side.

Therefore, again, there is a problem in demand. But now all that is behind us. There is pent up demand. You see it reflected in these big ticket consumer durables, whether it is automobiles or in consumer durable space. That is likely to continue because there is momentum in the economy. Going forward, you were talking a little while ago about the uncertainties of the monsoon they will certainly play a role but that will be visible from the second quarter of fiscal 19.

From July onwards, we will start worrying whether the monsoon has been good or bad, what the output will be, what the incomes of farmers in rural areas will be and that will affect sentiment but till that time, the results will come out to be better than what was seen last year because surely this demand will get reflected in profitability.

That seems to be the case highlight for us. How are you looking at the entire construction space right now? With so many orders being doled out, NHAI is getting particularly active on that front. How do you see the pickup in the hybrid annuity model of projects helping construction companies and road makers?

First of all, in the aggregate, the government has budgeted Rs 5.41 lakh crore in the Bharatmala project and the railways have increased budget from Rs 1.3 lakh crore to Rs 1.48 lakh crore. Now, all that gets reflected sooner or later. The implementation of the roads project is very rapid. We are doing very well -- 30-35 of lane kms per day. This is a very good achievement and this will continue so that demand emerges for these contractors and service providers. That leads to demand in other sectors whether it is steel or cement and so on.

Consumption expenditure has been doing well because of the good monsoons. Overall, the momentum in the economy continues as we have seen 7.2% growth. This year will be hopefully better if the monsoon is not negative. We will definitely cross 7.5% for fiscal 2019 and therefore all that will reflect in the profits.

Where we get affected is the global scene -- the rising oil price and corresponding inflation here. If the tariff wars do arrive, India will get affected. Plus the uncertainty of political outcomes with the Karnataka election in May and so many more elections including the central elections because the market would like the BJP to continue and do all the new initiatives that they talked about -- whether it was ease of doing business, introduction of the GST and so on.

If the government concentrated on just those micro factors and the ease of doing business, it would be wonderful for the economy. You will see the benefits of all the good things they have done come to the fore in terms of growth and so on.

One of the things they said in the budget was fixed term contract employment would be permissible across the board for companies and not just limited to any sector. If that is implemented, we are waiting for the circular or for the guidelines to come out. But if that is implemented efficiently, you can see a lot of job creation and that will be an engine of growth itself."

522,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 03:09 PM IST",PTI,Economy,States allowed to set up crop insurance firms to execute PMFBY,"The Centre has allowed states to set up their own insurance companies for implementing Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), a senior Agriculture Ministry official said today.

The move comes after several requests from states as well as observations made by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its 2017 report that old crop insurances schemes which have now been merged with PMFBY, were poorly implemented during 2011-2016.

""We have allowed the states to establish their own crop insurance companies to implement PMFBY subject to participation in bidding process,"" the official told PTI.

Presently, five public sector insurers and 13 private insurance companies are empanelled for implementation of the scheme, the official said.

The public insurers include Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC), United India Insurance Company (UICC), National Insurance Company (NIC), Oriental Insurance Company (OIC) and New India Assurance Company NSE 0.21 % (NIAC).

Launched in April 2016 , PMFBY provides comprehensive crop insurance from pre-sowing to post harvest against non-preventable natural risks at extremely low premium rate of 2 per cent for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for rabi crops and 5 per cent for horticulture and commercial crops.

The balance premium is paid equally by the centre and state. Claims are settled on the basis of yield loss assessed at the end of the season.

During the 2017-18 crop year (July-June), 4.79 crore farmers have been covered under PMFBY and the government is in the process of assessing the claims."
523,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 03:18 PM IST",,Expert Views,"We are seeing green shoots in rural areas and expect it to continue this year: Saugata Gupta, Marico","Talking to ET Now, Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO, Marico NSE 0.49 % talks about the future growth plans of the industry as well as of the company.

FMCG companies are posting great growth numbers on volumes and revenues. Is this attributable to the low base and the restocking or is underlying demand actually coming back?

It is a mix of two. The companies had a very low base of the demonetisation quarter in the preceding Q3. Having said that, we are seeing some green shoots in rural areas and are hoping that the next year will be a better one for the industry especially after the initiatives adopted by the government in the rural sector to improve the incomes which will further then improve the demand.

Both in Q2 and Q3, rural sales outperformed urban sales with 26% sales growth. What do you think has aided the strong bounce back in rural demand and is it sustainable?

As mentioned earlier, some of the increase in sales attribute to the low base. Apart from it, we even achieved a little share due to the fact that certain inflationary conditions transforms into gain in market share. Therefore, it is a mixture of both.

For the first time in the last two quarters, we have had a situation of rural growth being higher than urban growth and we expect that trend to continue even in the next year. However, this trend will be gradual rather than drastic.

With rural recovery still in early days. Do you believe rural growth is very vulnerable to factors like monsoon, government initiatives and how much of a havoc would you say unfavourable monsoon can play on rural sales?

Monsoon is one of the factors but having said that if some of the schemes that has been announced by the government are executed well, then consumption in the rural sector will witness significant increase. Also, If one look at the trends, there has been couple of years where monsoon has not been good but has not entirely affected the sales. Therefore, it depends on a mix of factors and I believe trend wise, next year will be better than the previous year.

In the categories that you are present, is there a significant presence of the unorganised sector and have you seen any shift has march in favour of organised companies like yourselves?

From a long-term perspective, organised players and companies with better direct distribution in post GST era and scales and efficiencies will have a better level playing field and an advantageous position than unorganised sector.

However, things are still settling down in the post GST era especially in the wholesale, but still from medium to long term, there is certainly competitive advantage for organised players.

Your volume growth at 9 per cent was a tad bit lower compared to your immediate peers like Dabur, Godrej which delivered 13 per cent to 18 per cent volume growth respectively. What are your thoughts or comments on that?

If one look at our base of last year, our volume decline was only minus four, which was lower than certain peer companies but the biggest reason behind not getting a double digit volume growth given the low base was the decline in Saffola’s sales as the product could not grow on that quarter due to certain short term problems. We however, believe that Saffola should be back on growth next year.

Copra prices have fallen significantly in the last few weeks. Is that true? Have you seen cost pressures abate?

There has been a slight fall but one needs to look at it from a year on year basis. This pressure on input cost will continue in the first half of the year. Although, the second half of the year will be definitely better.

So do you think this downtick in copra prices is temporary because we understand that supply pressures still exist?

With the new season approaching in April, I believe that the worst is over and the peak has happened. However, we will get a much better call of how it will perform in terms of whether there will be significant lowering in the second half of the year, only by May and June.
But from the year on year perspective, the cost pressure will continue to remain high in the first half and in the second half, because of the base factor, the prices would already be at peak, thereby making things better.

So if copra prices have indeed topped. Will you revisit Parachute prices given that you had undertaken a price hike in the past?

As of now no but we will take a call only after crop season in April -May as it will help in having a better view of the current price setup. But as of now, we do not intend to take it because at the end of the day, our effort will be to maximise volume growth and market share and we are okay to take some short term pains.

How is the Vago portfolio doing ? It has about 34% market share, have you been able to expand that, what is your distribution plan here?

We have been continuously gaining market share quarter after quarter. The only change which we have been tracking is that now, we have to drive both the bottom of pyramid and premiumisation. So, while we have been gaining value share, it has been lower than the volume share growth in the last four-five years. Our value share growth is currently around twenty-five and a half and therefore over the next two to three years, we will focus on driving both value and volume share growth.

How much of a worry would competitive be for you when it comes to hair oil especially now when you are penetrating the north and east market and where is the focus? Is it on volumes sustenance or profitability?

As an organisation, our philosophy is always to maximise volume growth and market share subject to a threshold level of margins. As long as we do not go below our threshold level of operating margin, we are going to concentrate on driving both volumes and market share especially at the places where we have been able to achieve significant profits in the last couple of years."

The 'sarsanghchalak' has voiced his strong opinion on the same issues the Sena had been raising, the party said, adding that this could be a ray of hope given the situation in the country.

""RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat pointed out that the administration has become weak and there is countrywide corruption. Because he admitted to corruption (in the country), will he be stamped as anti-national and anti-Hindu?"" the Sena asked in an editorial in its party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

The Sena was the first to speak on corruption and now Bhagwat has raised the same issues, it said.

Invoking warrior king Shivaji's rule, Bhagwat last week asked who should be blamed for the changed times, where a woman's safety is not guaranteed, and said India needed a protest against corruption.

He was addressing a gathering to mark the death anniversary of the 17th century Maratha king in Raigad district.

""The country has always taken seriously the stands of Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray and the heads of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). These two top leaders never contested any polls but they strengthened the right-wing organisations working for people's causes,"" the Shiv Sena said.

Bhagwat, it said, has posed the difficult question of frequent protests against corruption by social organisations and political parties. Opposition parties, it remarked, had stalled the functioning of Parliament over the same reasons.

""Though there is a BJP-led government at the Centre, the actual control is in Nagpur (implying the RSS headquarters). And now, the RSS chief himself has raised the uncomfortable issues,"" it said.

Some BJP leaders wondered about the Shiv Sena criticising the Central and Maharashtra governments despite it being a part of the ruling dispensation. They even wonder whether the Sena has lost its balance, quipped the Uddhav Thackeray-led party.

The Shiv Sena, the editorial said, welcomed Bhagwat's appeal of setting aside castes and its tensions.

The Sena also pointed to violence in West Bengal after sword-wielding BJP supporters allegedly defied that state government's ban on armed rallies on Ram Navami. In this context, the ""RSS chief could be disappointed with the non-construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya"", the editorial said.

The Sena also raised issues related to inflation and the education system.

Sadly, the CBSE exam paper leaks are now linked to an alleged leader of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS, it said.

Bhagwat's comments could prove to be a ray of hope against this backdrop, it added.

The Sena said the NCP was currently organising 'halla bol' rallies in some parts of Maharashtra to mobilise people against the alleged corruption at the Centre and in the state. ""For a moment, it looked like the RSS chief was heading that rally (while Bhagwat spoke on corruption in Raigad),"" it said."

According to a notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh and eight police stations bordering Assam were declared ""disturbed"" areas under the AFSPA, 1958.

The Act gives special rights and immunity to security forces in carrying out various operations in ""disturbed"" areas. It gives security personnel the power to search premises and arrest without warrant, to use force even to the extent of causing death.

""And whereas a further review of the law and order situation in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh and in the area falling within the jurisdiction of eleven police stations in districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the state of Assam, has been undertaken.

""Now, therefore, Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of the following eight police stations in the districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the state of Assam, are declared as disturbed area' under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 up to September 30, 2018 w.e.f. April 1, 2018, unless withdrawn earlier,"" the notification said.

The eight police stations are -- Balemu and Bhalukpong police stations in West Kameng district, Seijosa police station in East Kameng district, Balijan police station in Papumpare district, Namsai and Mahadevpur police stations in Namsai district, Roing police station in Lower Dibang Valley district and Sunpura police station in Lohit district.

As per RBI directive, FIMMDA has ceased to publish prices/yield of government securities from March 31, 2018.

It was set up in 1998 as a voluntary market body for bond, money and derivatives market and is an interface with the regulators on various issues that impact the functioning of these markets.

In a recent notification, RBI said: ""FBIL will commence publication of the g-sec (government securities) and SDL (state development loans) valuation benchmarks based on the extant methodology. Going forward, FBIL will undertake a comprehensive review of the valuation methodology.""

Banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), primary dealers, co-operative banks and all financial institutions which are required to value government securities as per FIMMDA may use FBIL prices, it said further.

530,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:06 PM IST",Bloomberg,Stocks,Emerging markets get thumbs up after staring down tough quarter,"As the old American Timex watch advertising slogan went, they took a lickin’ and kept on tickin’.

Emerging-market stocks beat peers from developed nations in the first quarter as investors tangled with an escalation in trade tensions, a jump in bond yields and bank-funding costs, and a sell-off in technology stocks. And investors, strategists and traders remain bullish on emerging assets for the rest of 2018, a Bloomberg survey shows.

Top picks are Asian stocks, followed by Latin American bonds, according to the survey of 15 participants conducted March 22-28. In currencies, Asia came tops again, ahead of Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Latin America.


""Gradual gains in emerging-market asset prices are still expected, given their healthy economic conditions and tame inflation,"" said Takeshi Yokouchi, a senior fund manager in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $53 billion. That’s after indexes of emerging-market currencies and equities from MSCI capped five quarters of gains in March.

There are headwinds to mind, though. The Mexican peso, Chinese yuan and South Korea’s won are seen most vulnerable to trade disruptions stemming from US President Donald Trump’s protectionist moves, the survey shows. Turkey, Brazil and Mexico are seen to be more sensitive to local political developments.

See here a list of elections that could pose tests for markets.

Below are the results of the survey:



For the charts below, respondents were asked which among 11 emerging-market currencies are most likely to be affected by the risks (positive or negative) cited.



The survey was taken before the Trump administration’s announcement on detailed plans for tariffs on Chinese imports, which in turn could trigger Chinese retaliation and disrupt international supply chains that involve production in emerging markets.



Asian economies are seen more tied to China, with risks headlined by a high-stakes financial deleveraging campaign that policy makers hope won’t endanger a targeted 6.5 per cent growth rate.


Meantime, there’s always the potential for a boost, or a hit, from commodity prices.



A slide in US technology shares that triggered a global sell-off in March showcased the knock-on effects for emerging markets as well.



While the Fed is pressing ahead with policy normalization, the European Central Bank is still pumping liquidity that’s spilling over into global markets, and is set to do so probably through year-end. The Bank of Japan isn’t expected to start its exit from mega-stimulus at least until 2019.



Turning to geopolitics, the currencies seen most at risk are tied to countries that have been embroiled in diplomatic disputes -- think Russia’s Cold War-style tensions with the US and Europe, and Turkey’s spats with the US and Germany.



And finally there are domestic political risks. Looming presidential elections in Brazil and Mexico will be closely watched, with potentially significant impacts on their financial markets depending on who wins.

531,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 09:39 PM IST",ET Online,Visa and Immigration,Why the US and the world are turning hostile to Indian workers,"NEW DELHI: Increasingly, the world wants to shut the door on Indian professionals, especially the tech workers, who want to work in foreign countries. From today, the US has tightened the process to award H1-B visas. Given to highly skilled professionals to work in the US, the H1-B visas fuelled the growth of India's information technology companies over more than a decade. Now the visas will turn precious, with unprecedented scrutiny and zero tolerance for even minor errors. In addition to this, all visa applicants will be subjected to extreme social-media vetting.

Earlier in March, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services had announced that it would temporarily suspend the premium processing for the H-1B visa. The Donald Trump administration recently announced a new measure, making the approval of H-1B visa tougher. Any company will have to make one more clarification to prove that its H-1B employee at a third-party worksite has specific and non-qualifying speculative assignments in a speciality occupation.

As the globalisation project shrivels due to protectionist tendencies emerging across the world in developed economies, the future abroad for highly skilled Indians is likely to turn bleak.

The US is not the only country averse to Indian tech workers. The UK too had revised its immigration laws. In November 2016, the UK announced its new visa rules which set a higher salary threshold for anyone applying under the Tier 2 intra-company transfer (ICT) category under which Indian tech companies take their workers to the UK. The anxieties over highly skilled foreign workers express in a variety of ways. Last month, a group of highly skilled Migrants, which represents nearly 1,000 doctors, engineers, IT professionals and teachers from countries outside the European Union (EU), protested against UK Home Office delays and unjustified refusals related to their applications for indefinite leave to remain in Britain.

Indian students once flocked to the UK but now the number has been going down due to concerns over Brexit and protectionist policies. December 2017 statistics for international students from the UK Council for International Student Affairs showed Indian students to the country fell a whopping 44% in the last five years. Despite the blip of a 10% increase in visas to Indian students in the year ending September 2017 from a year ago, the declining numbers is still causing concern. The increase in 2017 to 14,081, was the first time the figures rose since 2010, when 60,000 Indian students got visas. Strict student immigration laws since 2011 have seen Indian students looking to other destinations for higher education. The political uncertainty regarding Brexit bolsters the sentiment.

Recently, the Australian government blocked the most popular route Indians took to Australia — the subclass 457 visa category for skilled overseas workers. Instead, a new Temporary Skill Shortage visa has been introduced from March 18. The abolished visa was a big attraction for Indians who wanted to work in Australia. Of the 90,000-odd holders of this type of visa, 22% were Indians. New visa norms are restrictive and would certainly make it difficult for Indians to find work in Australia. Earlier, New Zealand, another popular destination for Indians looking to work abroad, and Singapore tightened its visa rules.

The visa restrictions will hit career dreams of a large number of Indians. There was a time in India when studying abroad was considered a mark of privilege. But rise of the middle class in has turned that privilege into a common aspiration. More and more parents now want their children to study abroad. The number of Indian parents wanting their children to study abroad jumped from 47% in 2016 to 62% in 2017, according to an HSBC report on education. A world becoming increasingly hostile to Indian workers means the road ahead for these aspirational young Indians is hard.

Indian parents' top three university destinations for their children are the USA, Australia and the UK — the very countries now trying to block immigrant workers.

Though local economic pressures, rising unemployment and cultural issues related to immigrants have led developed countries to tighten visa norms, one reason is perception of Indian professionals as a threat to local jobs.

The world is increasingly resisting Indian tech workers whose hard work for frugal salaries has become a legend. It's a bit of a stretch to see the Indian techies as the new imperialists, but the fear they evoke in the west might be based on what happened nearly a century ago.

With the industrial revolution in the west, India became a big importer of textiles from being a leader in textile exports in a matter of decades — due to cheap mass-manufacture technology. England's cheap machine-made textile goods ruined India's superior but costlier textile industry and a sophisticated banking system that financed it.

Indian tech companies are the new textile mills of Manchester and Lancashire, churning out cheap services with which the local IT services industry in the US cannot compete. While the English mills had a free run in absence of any tariff barriers in India, Indian tech companies face growing restrictions.

Now, Indian IT companies are seeking to overcome the visa-related challenges by setting up new centres in the US, a market that accounts for about 60 per cent of India's IT export basket. Infosys plans to set up four technology and innovation hubs in the US and hire about 10,000 locals there. Wipro has set up a technology centre in Plano, Texas, and plans to ramp up its headcount in the American state to 2,000 over the next few years."

In a written reply to Lok Sabha, Union Minister C R Chaudhary said the government has conducted a study on the impact of the duty hike by the US.

""India has also requested the US to exempt India from the steel and aluminium tariffs. India is examining all options to deal with the issue, in case not resolved bilaterally,"" he said.

Last month, US President Donald Trump signed two proclamations that levied 25 per cent tariff on steel and 10 per cent tariff on aluminium imported from all countries except neighbouring Canada and Mexico.

India exports around USD 1.5 billion worth of these products to America.

In a separate reply, the minister of state for commerce said as per WTO, India's gross national income per capita has crossed USD 1,000 for three consecutive years from 2013-2015.

Based on this, the country would have to phase out some of its export-related incentives which are not in compliance with the global trade rules.

""However, it is anticipated that there will be no immediate adverse impact on our foreign trade,"" he added."

The railways said across its zones, the protesters started gathering at the rail yards since early morning.

The services were disrupted when a mob arrived at the Ghaziabad yard around 10 am, Northern Railway officials said.

Many trains, including the Saptakranti Express, Utkal Express, Gatiman Express, the Bhubaneswar and Ranchi Rajdhani and the Kanpur Shatabdi, were stopped ahead of Ghaziabad at Meerut and Modinagar, Northern Railway officials said.

A mob of about 2,000 people disrupted the train services at the Hapur station as well, they added.

In the Agra Division, around 28 trains were delayed, including a Shatabdi and the Gatiman Express.

At the Ferozpur yard, a mob of about 150 people arrived at 8:30 am, resulting in disruption in the movement of trains. Another mob of around 200 people disrupted the services in the Amritsar-Ludhiana section.

The routes, officials said, were cleared of the protesters and the trains resumed their journey after a brief delay.

Around 43 trains were affected in the East Central Railways (ECR) because of the protests, which started as early as 5:10 am in the Dhanbad division. In Bihar, the protesters stormed the Patna Junction railway station, forcibly closed down the ticket booking counters and squatted on the tracks.

In the East Coast Railway (ECoR), around four train services were disrupted, with the protesters squatting in the Sambalpur and Khurda Road divisions as early as 5:15 am.

Across the North Eastern Railway (NER), South Eastern Railway (SER) and Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR), around 18 train services were disrupted. The trains resumed their journey after 9:30 am.

Several Dalit organisations have called for a ""Bharat bandh"" today to express their concerns over the dilution of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

The Supreme Court had, on March 20, diluted the provisions of the Act and said government servants should not be arrested without prior sanction and private citizens, too, should be arrested only after an inquiry under the law.

Dalit organisations, including the Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch, and some political parties fear that the dilution of the provisions of the Act may lead to increase in violence against Dalits."

ET Now exclusively learns JSW is getting set to partner the Numetal consortium to bid for Essar Steel.

Sources say the cash rich JSW is likely to be a minority investor in the Numetal consortium, but will hold operational control. JSW is expected to replace the Essar founder's son--Rewant Ruia--in the Numetal consortium.

JSW has declined to comment, and Numetal is yet to respond to ET Now's queries.

Just last week the media reticent Sajjan Jindal had publicly stated JSW was being barred from bidding for Essar Steel in the second round as the steel baron had not participated in the Expression of Interest stage, and thus did not have access to data room for the company.

Jindal said the creditors took this view despite him assuring them in writing that the bidding process would not get delayed with JSW's entry. Hence, Sajjan Jindal perhaps had no choice but to partner with an entity that had participated in the EoI stage.

Numetal was perhaps the easiest choice for JSW in short notice, sicne it had been disqualified earlier for the stake being held by a related party, ie Rewant Ruia.

Cases of vandalism were reported from Jamnagar during the protests held as part of a nationwide bandh called by Dalit organisations against ""dilution"" of the act following a Supreme Court ruling.

After getting reports of roadblocks and attacks on some BRTS (bus rapid transit system) buses in the city's eastern part, the Ahmedabad civic body halted its services on some of the routes, Municipal Commissioner Mukesh Kumar said.

""Some of the BRTS buses were targeted by protesters following which we discontinued our services on some of the routes.

""Operation of buses on some of the routes of AMTS (Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service) was also suspended,"" he said.

Dalit protesters took to streets in several parts of the city such as Dani Limda, Naroda, Bapunagar, Kalupur and Amraiwadi, among others.

According to Rahul Parmar of the Dalit Panther, several roads were blocked in these areas, while shops were asked to down shutters by the protesters.

According to in-charge city Police Commissioner K L N Rao, adequate police personnel were deployed across the city to deal with any law and order problem arising out of the protests.

""The situation is under control. We have deployed adequate force to deal with any unwarranted situation. Police have been regularly patrolling in the city,"" said Rao.

In state capital, Gandhinagar, Dalit protesters held a rally near the main bus station.

In Rajkot, agitators tried to enforce the pan-India shutdown by asking shopkeepers to close their establishments in several parts of the city, an official said.

Several Dalit activists and Congress workers symbolically burnt copies of the Supreme Court order related to the act at Trikon Baug in Rajkot, the official said.

Some protesters entered into a mall on Kalavad Road in Rajkot and forced the management to shutdown the complex, the official added.

Similar agitations were held in Surendranagar, Kutch Jamnagar, Mehsana and other parts of Gujarat.

In Jamnagar city, a mob tore posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi put up inside a bus depot. The mob also vandalised several shops in and around the depot, the official said.

In Jamnagar and Surendranagar, a large number of Dalit agitators squatted on railway tracks, forcing trains to stop for sometime, said police control room officials of both the districts.

Normal life was affected in many other cities as protesters either disrupted road traffic or tried to close main markets, the official said.

The bandh has been called by several Dalit outfits to express concerns over the ""dilution"" of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

The apex court in a March 20 order had said government servants should not be arrested without prior sanction and private citizens, too, should be arrested only after an inquiry under the law.

These outfits and some political parties fear the ""dilution"" of the provisions might lead to an increase in violence against Dalits."

The Centre sought an open court hearing and said that the safeguards would render the law toothless.

The review plea filed by the Ministry of Social Justice argued the safeguards would dilute the objective of protecting the marginalised sections and expose them to more violence and atrocities in a caste-ridden milieu while urging the court to recall the ruling. “Procedural checks by way of a preliminary enquiry as directed by the court would tend to reduce the rates of registration of cases, conviction, increased pendency and per se could act as deterrent in even filing of FIRs,” the review plea said. “It has escaped the attention of the court that contrary to assertion of misuse of 1989 Act, facts and data have demonstrated a weak implementation of the Act,” the Centre said.

Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and UU Lalit had in a judgment on March 20 ruled that anticipatory bail should be granted by the courts unless there was a prima facie case against the accused under the Act. The court had also instituted a mechanism under which the preliminary enquiries must be carried out before any arrest of the accused.

The bench had also ruled against arbitrary, immediate arrests of any accused, insisting it must be done with the written sanction of the competent authority in case of public servants and senior police officials in case of others to prevent such misuse."
542,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 04:08 PM IST",ETMarkets.com,Expert Views,"Capital markets have a huge role to play in SMEs: Manish Kumar, GREX & REALX","Speaking on the sidelines of ETMarkets Global Summit 2018, Manish Kumar, Co-Founder, GREX & REALX, says opening up of SMEs and enthusiasm that has really been shown of late in the SMEs is a good indication that this market can be developed and cultivated very well.

Edited excerpts:

What role do you think capital market can play when it comes to SMEs?

A huge role, actually. If you look at what is happening around, the banks are struggling for many reasons and when the banks are struggling, the whole economy appears to be in a chaos. We have a situation like this essentially because our equity markets are subdued. We have relied almost exclusively on the banking sector for providing all the credit requirements for growth. The other is equity capital. That is a different kind of capital. It has its own reasons. When you raise equity, it has its own reasons and you raise debt for other reasons.

The equity capital, the risk capital per se has almost been deficient in the growth of the nation. SMEs in general, do not really understand equity-led growth if you ask. Start-ups only understand equity-led growth. This is not harmonious and therefore we see all the challenges happening in the sector because all the load is carried by banking sector and there is interference, pressure, lack of information about growth, etc. If we start moving towards opening up of equity markets making it in some sense liberalised for companies to access, there should be multiple platforms, etc, that will open up risk taking and risk sharing and wealth creation in the economy and that is something that probably needs to be done today so that we move into a more balanced market structure.

Any idea on how we can move the needle for SMEs or MSMEs? I am not really sure of the micro ones want to get listed or even if it is desirable, but for SMEs how can the needle be moved from debt to equity? What can be some of the ways?

I come from private market construct and that can be a very nice construct for companies while they remain unlisted. While they have privileges of remaining unlisted and they can start trying out in a limited measure, what does it take to be compliant? What does it take to be transparent? What does it take to share information? Then maybe based on the encouragement, there has to be incentive to an action.

Such markets give an incentive to further positive actions as they move towards getting listed now that is one structure that we need to follow. We do exactly the same thing in the financial market. When you do not get a loan from bank, where do you get the money from? An NBFC! The rate of interest may be higher but once you show your credibility of servicing a loan, then that is when you get enabled for a banking loan at a lower rate. That kind of structure needs to be available to companies to access that first, try it out and move to the more liquid markets.

Are the current forms of SME exchanges on the BSE and MSE playing an adequate role in this?

Yes, that is a good beginning in the sense that from the investor’s side this asset class was not available. In terms of risk taking, that has to first become very central to how we think our financial well being. We are not growing as an economy until we start taking risk and until we start understanding risks, etc. Now, opening up of SMEs and enthusiasm that has really been shown of late in the SMEs is a good indication that this market can be developed and cultivated very well.

When we talk about corporate debt, we have not done good financial market even for corporate debt of larger sizes. Think about what we can do on a non-banking corporate debt side even on the equity side. The potential for such things is very large and immense. We are just opening up.

If you look at the data of both NSE and BSE, you will see it is heavily skewed towards states like Gujarat. Delhi comes in next and there are only around 12 or 13 states, some of them just have one stock which have been listed. How do we make sure that the entire country can see what the SME exchange has to offer?

The reason might be because you have more number of market intermediaries in these states and your data would corroborate that Gujarat and Maharashtra have more brokers and merchant bankers, etc. Wherever there were more intermediaries, we were seeing greater action, a very natural phenomenon. But we probably need to look at how to increase more awareness and more intermediaries operating out of other clusters."

All India Federation of SC/ST organisations, a conglomerate of nearly 150 employees groups, said large-scale nationwide violence has taken place in which several people have lost their lives and therefore the petition should be heard urgently.

A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said that the petition will be heard in due course of time.

Advocate Manoj Gaurkella, appearing for the employees federation said that the recent verdict passed by the apex court on March 20 was ""unfair and unjust and it should be stayed"".

He said that this writ petition should be heard by a larger bench of five judges to decide the issue.

The apex court had on March 20 said that on ""several occasions"", innocent citizens were being termed as accused and public servants deterred from performing their duties, which was never the intention of the legislature while enacting the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

The top court had said that unless the exclusion of anticipatory bail is limited to ""genuine cases and inapplicable to cases where there is no prima facie case was made out, there will be no protection available to innocent citizens"".

It had said that ""in view of the acknowledged abuse of law of arrest in cases under the Atrocities Act, arrest of a public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority and of a non-public servant after approval by the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) which may be granted in appropriate cases if considered necessary for reasons recorded.""

It also said that the reasons recorded must be scrutinised by the magistrate for permitting further detention.

To avoid false implication of an innocent, the top court directed that a preliminary enquiry may be conducted by the DSP rank officer to find out whether the allegations make out a case under the Atrocities Act and whether the allegations are not frivolous or motivated.

The ruling came on a plea of Subhash Kashinath Mahajan, who while serving as the Director of Technical Education in Maharashtra government, was accused of refusing prosecution sanction against two senior officers of the department accused under SC/ST Act by a store keeper.

Mahajan challenged the order of May 5, 2017, of the Bombay High Court which had refused to grant him anticipatory bail in the case and quash the FIR."

Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to an open court hearing on Centre's review petition over judgement on SC/ST Act.

The violent protests on Monday hit life across the country with some states ordered closure of educational institutions and curtailed communication and transport services, including rail, incidents of arson and vandalism were reported from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Utar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab, among other states.

Hundreds of protesters carrying swords, sticks, baseball bats and flags forced shopkeepers and other establishments to shut down in several cities of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Odisha and Jharkhand. There were also reports of shooting, arson and clashes with police forces.

While six people were killed in crossfiring in Madhya Pradesh alone, two died in Uttar Pradesh and one in Rajasthan. Curfew was imposed in several places and hundreds were detained.

The Army and paramilitary forces were also put on standby in Punjab. Normal life was affected in several parts of Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra and Gujarat too.

Dalit activist Ashok Bharti’s message on WhatsApp for Bharat Bandh against the dilution of the SC/ST Act is under the scanner of the intelligence agencies that are intensely monitoring the spread of agitation through e-platforms.

Political leaders like Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee expressed themselves on the prevailing agitation. Taking a dig at PM Modi, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that the Dalits continue to be deprived of their basic rights under the Modi government. Former Uttar Pradesh CM Mayawati strongly supported the agitation led by Dalit. She went on to say, ""I support the protest against the SC/ST Act. I have got to know that some people spread violence during the protests, I strongly condemn it. Our party is not behind the violence during the protests"".

The Union home ministry walked a tightrope to contain the damages, even as it issued advisory and offered paramilitary assistance to contain violence.

The ministry was also policing the social media to identify brains behind the mass protests that rattled the national capital too.

Jaibhagwan Jatav, a former chief patron of Bhim Army and president of Rashtriya Soshit Parishad, acknowledged to ET that the social media tools were instrumental in gathering unprecedented support for the bandh. “No one knows who organised it,” he said.

The Dalit leader said the community was not happy with the government seeking a review of the Supreme Court judgement. “Why can’t they bring a legislation in parliament to overrule the SC judgement?” Jatav said.

WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
The Dalit groups are protesting against a March 20 order of a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. SC had removed restrictions on granting anticipatory bail and imposed a condition that a public servant could be prosecuted only after obtaining permission from higher authorities.

DEMANDS
Dalit groups claim that this adverse order would not have been given if the Centre had represented the NCRB comparative data properly.


WHAT THE CENTRE HAS DONE
It has filed a review petition before Supreme Court contending:
a) It will defeat object of the law i.e., protecting the marginalised
b) Dilute the rigour of law, making it toothless
c) Reduce the deterrent factor
d) Make weaker sections more vulnerable
e) Piece of affi rmative, beneficial law whose validity has been earlier upheld

551,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 04:21 PM IST",PTI,Politics,Bharat Bandh: Violence in Madhya Pradesh during bandh by Dalit outfits,"BHOPAL:Four persons were killed and several others, including policemen, sustained injuries in violent protests in Madhya Pradesh during the nationwide bandh called today by Dalit outfits against the alleged dilution of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Curfew was clamped in three districts including Bhind, where the Army was called in to control the situation.

""Two people were killed in Gwalior while one person each died in Bhind and Morena districts during the violence,"" Inspector General (law and order) Makrand Deoskar told PTI.

Incidents of stone-pelting, arson and loot were also reported from several parts of the state during the protest, he said, adding that further details are awaited.

A student leader, identified as Rahul Pathak, died in firing in Morena district, Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Umesh Shukla told PTI.

Pathak was allegedly shot by agitators and he succumbed to injuries enroute to hospital, he said.

As the violence escalated, curfew was imposed in the entire city, Shukla said.

The protesters also stopped a train in Morena, the police said.

Curfew was also imposed in Gwalior and Bhind districts following violence, officials said. Gwalior Commissioner B M Sharma said, ""Curfew has been imposed in several parts of the Gwalior city following violence during the protest.""

The Tahtipur, Gola Ka Mandir, Hazira and Morar police station areas in Gwalior were brought under the purview of the curfew, a senior official said.

Curfew was also imposed in Bhind city, and Mehgaon, Lahar, Gohad and Machand areas of the district, Bhind Superintendent of Police Prashant Khare said.

The Army has been called in Bhind to control the situation, Khare said.

A person, identified as Mahavir Singh (32), died in the firing in Bhind district where while two others suffered serious injuries and were referred to a hospital in Gwalior, Bhind's chief medical and health officer J P S Kushwaha said.

In Jhabua, protesters looted shops during the agitation, triggering tension in the tribal town.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appealed to the protesters to maintain peace in the state as the Centre has filed a review petition in the Supreme Court.

Protests were also held in the state capital Bhopal with agitators blocking a road on the Board Office Square near the statue of Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar.

More than two dozen vehicles were damaged, several of them torched by the protesters, eyewitnesses said.

In Morena district, the Chhattisgarh Express was stopped by protesters and was till at the station, they said.

The Supreme Court had on March 20 diluted certain provisions of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, in a bid to protect 'honest' public servants discharging bona fide duties from being blackmailed with false cases under the Act.

The verdict is being widely criticised by the Dalits and the Opposition, who claim that dilution of the Act will lead to more discrimination and crimes against the backward community."

Earlier in July 2017, the board of directors of the bank had approved the re-appointment of Shikha Sharma as the managing director and chief executive officer for three years with effect from June 1, 2018.

The board decision is pending regulatory approval.

The veteran banker is serving the second term that comes to an end in June 2018. She joined Axis Bank in 2009 with a five-year mandate which was subsequently extended.

""The bank's board follows a standard process with regard to senior appointments, and forwards its recommendations to the regulator (to the extent required). This process is currently under progress,"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.

""We have no further comments to offer as the report appearing in the media is speculative,"" the bank clarified.

Media reports were rife until a year ago about her re-appointment with the bank and also that she was sounded out by salt-to-information technology conglomerate Tata Sons to head company's financial services business.

Stock of Axis Bank ended 2.20 per cent down at Rs 498.20 on BSE."

""India needs market pricing to provide oil to all,"" Pradhan said at an event organised to mark the launch of Euro-VI grade petrol and diesel in the national capital.

Fuel pricing is based on a transparent mechanism, he said, attributing the spurt in rates to happening in international market. ""When crude oil prices rise, naturally consumer feels a pinch,"" he said.

""We are concerned (about the impact on consumers). We are keeping a close eye on the developing international oil scenario,"" he said.

He, however, did not offer any hint of a government intervention like cutting excise duty to give relief to consumers.

""Centre and state bank on tax revenues to meet developmental needs. 42 per cent of collections from excise duty (on petrol and diesel) goes to states and out of the remaining 60 per cent is used to fund centre's share in development schemes in states,"" he said.

Pradhan said the GST Council - the apex decision making body of the new indirect tax regime - should in the ""interest of energy security and consumers"" include petroleum products in GST.

Petrol, diesel, natural gas, crude oil and jet fuel (ATF) are currently not included in GST, which essentially leads to producers not being able to set-off tax paid on inputs from final tax on product.

The government, he said, had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre in October and some states had followed it up with a reduction in VAT (value added tax).

""When there is a pricing issue, states should respond and cut VAT,"" he said.

State-owned oil firms, which have been since June last year revising auto fuel prices daily, today raised petrol price by 10 paise per litre and diesel by 11 paise.

Petrol in the national capital now costs Rs 73.83 a litre, the highest since September 14, 2014 when rates had hit Rs 76.06. Diesel price at Rs 64.69 is the highest ever, with previous high of Rs 64.22 being on February 7, 2018.

India has the highest retail prices of petrol and diesel among South Asian nations as taxes account for half of the pump rates.

The government raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.

Subsequent to that excise duty reduction, the Centre had asked states to also lower VAT but just four of them -- Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- reduced rates while others including BJP-ruled ones ignored the call.

The central government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in October 2017, when petrol price reached Rs 70.88 per litre in Delhi and diesel Rs. 59.14. Because of the reduction in excise duty, diesel prices had on October 4, 2017 come down to Rs 56.89 per litre and petrol to Rs 68.38 per litre. However, a global rally in crude prices pushed domestic fuel prices far higher than those levels.

The October 2017 excise duty cut cost the government Rs 26,000 crore in annual revenue and about Rs 13,000 crore during the remaining part of the current fiscal year.

The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices. In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government's excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.

State-owned oil companies -- Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation NSE -0.22 % and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation -- in June last year dumped the 15-year old practice of revising rates on the 1st and 16th of every month . Instead, they adopted a daily price revision system to instantly reflect changes in cost. Since then, prices are revised on a daily basis."

""The alliance between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party is certainly not a natural one. This can be simply proved by the statement of a senior SP leader, who had recently said in the UP Vidhan Parishad that his party had sent a number of people to jail in NRHM scam. Now, tell me who were the accused in the NRHM scam?"" Shahi told PTI here today.

Sharpening his attack, the UP cabinet minister said, ""In the NRHM scam, if there was any main role, it was of the leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party, and it took place during their tenure"".

In a way, they have compromised with corruption, he alleged.

""Now if there is any electoral understanding among those who have sold the sugar mills of the state and those who have looted the money meant for welfare schemes of the poor, I think that such electoral understanding or alliance can never work for the betterment of the villagers, economically weaker sections of the society or for labourers,"" he said.

Asked how he viewed the challenge posed by rivals in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Shahi said, ""BJP is a competent party from the organizational point of view. It will activate its entire organization, and face all the challenges in the best possible manner.""

He exuded confidence that the party would devise its strategy for the elections to UP Legislative Council elections and deliver a splendid performance.

The UP agriculture minister on this occasion said that the state government was committed to doubling the income of the farmers, and in this regard, the government has come up with 'Kisan Paathshalas'.

""Apart from this, the first branch of International Rice Research Institute (based in Phillippines) in the country will be set up in Varanasi, and work in this regard is going on,"" he said."

Reddy said between 2008 and 2013, when the BJP ruled the state, the number of criminal cases registered was 1,12,213 whereas 1,13,939 such cases were reported from May 2013 to February 2018.

""My government did not stop mining activity. In fact, my government was responsible for ensuring that there was enough money in the hands of every mining-dependent person and their (those working in the sector) livelihood was protected,"" he said.

Kamat was addressing a press meet, where outgoing Goa Congress president Shantaram Naik was also present.

The mining industry in Goa faced a severe jolt in 2012 when the Supreme Court banned mining activities after massive irregularities in the sector came to light.

The key industry, which resumed operations in 2015 following lifting of the ban, is facing a fresh crisis since mid-March after the apex court quashed 88 mining leases.

Kamat said he has a solution to the current crisis but declined to reveal its contours.

The former chief minister said he will not give any suggestion to the BJP-led government in Goa on how to deal with the crisis though he knows ways to handle the situation.

""I have the capacity to handle the mining crisis. But why should I give suggestions to the government? If the Congress forms a government in Goa in future, then I will disclose it (the solution),"" he said, responding to a query.

""One requires will power and intelligence to handle such a situation,"" the Congress leader maintained.

Kamat said he showed his will power, when as chief minister, he scrapped the government's special economic zone policy following opposition from the people of the state.

""Let me tell you one thing - I am the only chief minister in the entire country who (when in office) dared to scrap the SEZ policy and de-notify SEZs,"" he said.

Kamat, who handled the mines portfolio when he was chief minister, has been named in nearly half a dozen cases arising out of the mining scam which was unearthed by a judicial commission.

The alleged irregularities related to mining without licence, mining outside lease area and transporting minerals illegally, resulting in losses to the exchequer.

Goa is a major exporter of iron and manganese ores.

Kamat has been booked under IPC sections related to cheating, criminal conspiracy and relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Mines and Minerals Act.

The Congress leader has denied any wrongdoing."

Edited excerpts:

One of the important aspects to watch out for in the market is what is happening in the two-wheelers space. Hero set a record sales for FY17 and we are seeing Bajaj Auto NSE -0.06 % come out with a good set of numbers. Eicher is a known story. Do you think the two-wheelers will play catch up to the outperformers in the four-wheeler pack?

To a certain extent, four-wheelers will have a better impact on the sales side rather than two-wheelers. We are more positive for the four-wheeler segment. The story on discretionary spending and in rural economy revival is growing at a decent pace. The way auto pack numbers are showing on an average 15% growth for at least March and FY17-18 ending, we believe that for two-wheelers per se, there is much competition and the price competition is such that margin can be kept.

The upside is very much capped for the margin unless and until a new launch happens. So, with the new launches, TVS Motors and Hero MotoCorp can have some good ongoing margin stability but not as of now. There we have a neutral stance. On the four-wheelers, pack the way Maruti’s New Dezire has taken a very gung-ho sentiment to the buyers where we believe hat even a small expansion into the gross profit margin can take a leap towards earnings potential.

We are gung-ho about Maruti and Ashok Leyland NSE -0.28 % in the commercial vehicles space.

It is a tale of two cities. On one hand, it is pharma which is holding fort for the market and giving it the kind of strength that it needs at this juncture. On the flip side, it is banks all the way led by ICICI Bank and Axis Bank which are bringing the entire index down. How are you placing these two stories when it comes to talking to your clients?

You mean to say in the pharma and the banking?

That is right.

In terms of at least the banking side, we are very much comfortable and confident with BFSI segment in private sector banks especially and avoiding PSU banks as of now because there is a lot of ambiguity and quarterly results are on the cards and may be it will start flowing for the PSU banks from end of this month.

But provisions and other terms needs to be seen very closely for the final year closure. We are just putting our hands out of that box and we are much more confident about the growth trajectory for the private sector banks and the BFSI segment. As far as NBFC companies are concerned, we are driving ideas where the prices have corrected or have not at all as in some of the cases.

We are finding more comfort on buying side for investors like private sector banks. HDFC Bank is the leader here but IndusInd Bank has also seen a 20-22% growth rate. We are confident about the growth trajectory of IndusInd Bank and at these valuation around, the 3.4-3.6 times price to book, that stock can command a little bit of premium over peer companies and growth can be there with the 15%-20% upside in the stock.

In just about a week’s time, we will be talking earnings for FY18. What about the IT majors? What can they say or do that can change opinion for the bellwether names through the course of FY19?

We are still working on the numbers where sector wise and overall, the basket of the Nifty and the Sensex companies will deliver. On the IT front, the back-ended calculation shows that around 4.5-6.5% kind of a revenue growth can be estimated on the average side.

On the large cap space, a maximum revenue growth of 6.5% can be expected. So, that is only a ballpark. We have done the summary estimate right now, but by the end of the week, we will be coming out with a strategy report.

I wanted to do a quick status check on the new kid on the block from the auto ancillary space. This one came in with quite a bit of an impact. So, 3.5% done for the new company which has now come in on to the bourses. What did you make of the new listing and how do you place it in the auto ancillary basket where there seems to be some sort of a valuation discount at this juncture?

For the new listing, the upside for the listing gain was very much capped and it is hardly up by 3 to 5%. But fair valuation is already there. It is a small company. So, rather than that, in the auto ancillary pack, we like the existing plays in the battery segment like Amara Raja NSE -0.34 % and Exide. Both are leading players and not traditional one with home inverters but cater to industrial segment.

The new disruption which will come in this sector is e-rickshaw segment which is almost a Rs 4000-crore market for both these players. They are a bit of a late entrant into this segment but the growth trajectory is still there plus the GST migration from unorganised to organised is right now at 50% and over next two-three years, it will gradually come down to 27-28% odd. So, the potential of the market is immense for these two players and valuation wise also at around Rs 40 EPS, Amara Raja is still quoting at almost 20 times PE multiple for the second half of FY19.

Similarly, Exide is also quoting at a similar valuation at Rs 12 EPS for FY20. Right now, it is a little less than Rs 240, so again at a little less than 20 times, it is available. So, unorganised to organised shift will be a major part. The OEM segment and the industrial segment for the inverter purpose is also going to grow at least 16% to 17% CAGR for over next two years."

573,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 12:25 PM IST",ETMarkets.com,Expert Views,Meeting regulatory expectation is the biggest challenge brokers are facing right now: Uttam Bagri,"Talking to Rahul Oberoi on the sidelines of ETMarkets Global Summit 2018, Uttam Bagri, Chairman, BSE Brokers' Forum, says technology is getting things together like never before and that is creating a lot of pressure on the brokers.

Edited excerpts:

What is your take on consolidation in the broking industry? How can it impact the conventional brokers?

Consolidation in the broking industry is like economics, it is going to happen. At some level, there are already talks that brokers should consolidate and share the common expenses but given the large market, everybody has his niche. So, consolidation is still not a necessity.

What is the future of SME brokers?

Broking as a service per se has become almost non-viable because of almost zero brokerages floating in the market. But many brokers are not sticking only for pure execution services, there are additional services that come in. For example, you could be selling mutual funds, you could be giving some investment advice, some may go for portfolio management in some way or the other. So, by giving a bouquet of services to a client, the brokers will survive. But yes, it is difficult for the SMEs but then they always survive.

What are the major challenges brokers are facing?

There are two; one is an economic challenge because throughout the world, there is dis-intermediation. Technology is getting things together like never before and that is creating a lot of pressure on the brokers.

The second issue is regulatory expectations. If you are a small or a large broker, the regulator says since you are handling clients’ money, you have to meet those minimum requirements. The regulator is not choosing to differentiate between different size and business models. That is the regulatory cost and meeting the regulatory expectation is the biggest challenge we are facing right now. Profit, loss to hum sambhal lenge (we will manage) but regulatory non-compliance has very serious reputational risk to us.

Over the years, how has the broking industry changed? What is the level of competition right now?

Competition is cut-throat but Indians are very particular about who they deal financially with. So, the relationships are sticky. If I am giving a better service or a higher customized service to my clients, my clients are ready to pay me a premium brokerage. This is not very high but they are ready to give me that additional premium which allows me to be profitable.

When the markets are moving anyway. everything is alright because the cake size is increasing. The real challenge will be if the cake starts reducing. Luckily, we do not see it on the horizon so far.

Do you think Indian investors are ready to pay for research reports?

Culturally, no because as Indians we do not like to pay for advice. I do not think the indian investors are ready to pay for good advice or research so far. You see some green shoots, some very educated and large-hearted guys are there, but even today, advice is deemed to be a part of a bundle of services along with execution and transaction.

What is the future of broking industry in India?

All brokers will need to increase the number of services they give and deal with not only execution. As long as you are adding value to your client, your clients will stick to you. It will give you business."

With just one dummy run, the system was implemented today and it faced multiple glitches.

The CBSE sent a confidential note to all examination centres in Delhi on Saturday, which carried a set of ten instructions to be followed to introduce the new system.

""In the light of the recent developments, CBSE has devised a mechanism of providing encrypted question paper at the examination centres just before the commencement of examination, the note read.

The instructions issued by the board to the centres included identifying a safe and secure room for installation of computers and printers and ensuring high-speed internet connection.

All computer teachers/staff were supposed to report to the examination centre by 7:30 AM on all exam days to handle downloading and printing of the encrypted question papers.

The schools were also asked to arrange adequate A4 sheets -- at least 10 pages per candidate.

""On exam day, the question paper will be available on the CBSE website. The same user ID and password as used for registration can be used. After downloading the zip file of the question paper, the centres have to use the password provided by the regional office minutes before and extract it,"" the note read.

The schools were also supposed to send details of the number of printers, computers installed, name of the computer staff or teacher in charge by 4 PM yesterday.

The board had directed those schools which do not have required facilities to hire the same, and centre superintendents to personally supervise the arrangements and ensure adequate security arrangements.

With limited time to understand and implement the robust ""leak-proof"" system, schools today struggled and the exam was delayed at a few centres. However, students were compensated for the lost time."

The NHRC has also observed that such instances would ""adversely affect the credibility of the institutions in which the students have absolute faith"".

The notices have been sent to the Secretary of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, chairperson of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the commissioner of Delhi Police, seeking a detailed report in four weeks, a senior NHRC official said.

""The HRD ministry is also expected to inform the Commission about the steps taken regarding counselling of the aggrieved students and to make the process of conducting board examinations trustworthy and foolproof to avoid recurrence of such painful incidents in future,"" the rights panel said in a statement.

This follows the approval of Electrosteel Steels Committee of Creditors (CoC) that met on March 29. The meeting was called to examine Abhishek Dalmia-led Renaissance Steel’s objections to Tata Steel and Vedanta‘s eligibility as bidders under Section 29 (A) of the IBC. Apart from Vedanta and Tata Steel, other bidders were Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors and Renaissance Steel.



Following the CoC meet on March 29, Vedanta was issued a Letter of Intent on March 30, 2018, after being declared a successful resolution applicant for ESL. Vedanta said in a statement it has accepted the terms of the LoI.

ESL informed the stock exchanges on April 1, 2018, that the CoC, constituted in terms of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), approved Vedanta’s resolution plan for the company.

Electrosteel Steels owes about Rs 10,734 crore to a group of lenders led by State Bank of India. The 270-day deadline for insolvency resolution process is due to get over on April 17.

581,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:17 PM IST",TNN,Environment,Govt expands ambit of emission standards for five industries to fight foul air,"NEW DELHI: Noting the increase in air pollution due to industrial units in many cities across the country, the Union environment ministry has expanded the ambit of emission standard norms of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) for five industries - ceramic, foundry industries (furnaces based on fuel), glass, lime kiln and reheating furnace - and asked states to ensure their implementation.


The emission standards for these industries were notified on March 22. It said the ministry took into account the “seriousness of air pollution that has direct impact on the human population” and therefore decided to waive of public\stakeholders’ consultation before notifying these standards under the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2018.

Normally, the ministry first puts out draft notification in public domain for comments. It then notifies it finally considering suggestions of stakeholders on the draft after 30 or 60 days.

Though the move to waive of consultation period will ensure that these standards come into force with immediate effect, its enforcement may be a big challenge keeping in view the inadequate capacity of state pollution control boards (SPCBs).

The ministry had earlier set environmental standards for the cement industry in 2016. It had also in December 2015 notified revised standards for coal-based thermal power plants (TPPs). The new standards, based on the recommendation of the central pollution control board (CPCB), were aimed at reducing emission of particulate matter (PM10), sulphur dioxide and oxide of nitrogen which would, in turn, help in bringing about an improvement in the ambient air quality (AAQ).

Enforcement of these standards for coal-based power plants have, however, been quite patchy with majority of the plants failing to meet the ministry’s earlier deadline of December 7, 2017.

Citing practical difficulties, the central electricity authority (CEA) had later sought extension of deadline for installation of necessary equipment to control emissions up to December, 2022 - five years more than what the TPPs had agreed in 2015.

Even the environment ministry had in December last year supported the CEA’s move in the Supreme Court. It had noted that since uninterrupted power supply in the country needs to be ensured at all times, it has to be done in phases to avoid problems in power supply as many units cannot be taken out for retrofitting at the same time."

The traders' body criticised Commerce & Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu for remaining silent on the issue despite drawing his attention to it several times.

""It appears that instead of promoting Indian retail trade, the Government is more interested in helping and encouraging MNCs to control and dominate the retail trade through e-commerce and FDI which is highly deplorable,"" CAIT said.

""It is more painful that even after specific assurance given to CAIT delegation by Prabhu himself, no step has been taken to draft a National Trade Policy for Retail Trade.

Therefore, it looks sure that domestic trade is never on the priority of the government though Prime Minister is advocating policies for small businesses time & again but all goes in vain,"" the traders' body said.

CAIT claimed that large number of e-commerce platforms are deeply engaged in predatory pricing and continuously offering deep discounts by funding the losses in contravention of the FDI policy which clearly make them responsible for maintaining the equal level playing field and debar them in influencing the prices.

""These e-commerce companies claims to be a marketplace but mass scale public advertisements by them in the recent past is nothing but to solicit the consumers directly. If in reality these companies are B2B marketplace place, then where is the need of conducting big scale advertisement campaign directly addressing the consumers... ,"" said the traders' body."

On Sunday, 1 April, the Minister had tweeted happy Utkal Divas to all Odias, like his Prime Minister and party colleagues. Goel had attached with the wishes, pictures of an earlier visit to the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneshwar, which included pictures of the Minister carrying out rituals in the sanctum sanctorium of the 11th century temple.

Phones and cameras are strictly prohibited inside the temple, considered one of the holiest in the state. The Minister’s tweet did not go unnoticed. The Lingaraj Temple Administration told the regional television channel Odisha TV (OTV), it would investigate how these pictures were allowed to be taken. In the meanwhile it wanted for the tweet to be deleted from Twitter.

In another tweet on Monday, Goel regretted his tweet, “Yesterday on the occasion of #UtkalaDibasa, I had by mistake tweeted pictures of the Lingaraja Temple from my trip last year. I did not wish to hurt anyone's sentiments and therefore, I am withdrawing the tweet/images.”"

Baker, Research VP, Gartner","Artificial Intelligence has significant benefits because it can deliver breakthroughs in business process and redefine the ways of doing business. In an interview with ETCIO.COM, Van L. Baker, Research VP, Gartner discusses the state of AI adoption across the enterprise landscape and the best practices organizations need to embrace in their journey to be an AI-powered business.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are the buzzwords and often seem to be used interchangeably. This perception often leads to confusion. Can you explain the difference?
Artificial Intelligence is about human intelligence exhibited by machines. Machine learning is an approach to achieve Artificial Intelligence. It uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it and then make a determination or prediction about something. Deep learning is a technique of implementing machine learning by using multilayer neural networks.

Which are the areas where AI can be brought to bear?
The business applications that most organizations have already have AI. Business applications of Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Workday already have AI deployment within them. So organizations don’t have to build it themselves.

I recommend AI for activities that can differentiate the enterprise rather than do cost reduction. In terms implementations, the low hanging fruits are the conversational AI/ Virtual assistants. We’re seeing very widespread interest in that area. We expect to see broad scale activity and PoC in this area. There will be an active adoption of the conversational interface because of the value proposition for the users in very compelling

Customer engagement applications, customer center service, and support, digital marketing platforms are some of the key areas where AI is being deployed. Some forward-looking enterprises are also adopting in for cybersecurity, financial management systems, manufacturing, and operations.

Skill gap, use case identification, strategy, and funding are key challenges to be overcome for organizations to adopt AI.

According to a recent survey conducted by Gartner, 54 % of the organizations deal with the lack of necessary staff skills, , 37 % are struggling to define their AI strategy, 35 % are scrambling to identify the right use cases for AI, 35 % are finding it difficult to get funding for AI initiatives, 30% are dealing with security or privacy concerns. There are also issues around the complexity of integrating AI with our existing infrastructure and determining how to measure value from using AI.

Access to data is one of the biggest impediments to the adoption of AI. How can organizations deal with it?
That’s right. Without the access to right data, AI projects are doomed to failure. There have been many high profile failures of AI projects.

Enterprises need to be very focused on data management, data cleansing, and data integrity. A lot of the organizations have data residing in multiple repositories. The source, origin, and authenticity of the data are debatable. So they have to find the data, cleanse the data and structure it in the right way.

How can enterprises prepare to take advantage of artificial intelligence?
Enterprises must make the use of AI features of packaged business applications pervasive in their organizations. They should start development of conversational agents as the onramp for use of AI services.

Organizations should test hosted AI services to determine the efficiency of standard models and the amount of data needed to add domain specific expertise. In addition, they should look to gradually incorporate deep learning and machine learning skills whether via acquisition or outsourcing

They should assess the skills on their teams on ML/AI capabilities and establish training programs for those that have the capability to learn."

590,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 08:08 AM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,RBI allows banks to spread bond trading losses over four quarters,"Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India took a U-turn in its rigid position on provisioning norms for banks suffering losses from bonds trading by permitting the lenders to spread out their trading losses over four quarters that would save them from scrambling for funds to meet provisioning norms on bankrupt cases.

To avoid returning to similar position in future, the central bank has said that banks should create Investment Fluctuation Reserve that could be dipped into in case there is a need to provide for bond losses in the years ahead.

“With a view to addressing the systemic impact of sharp increase in the yields on government securities, it has been decided to grant banks the option to spread provisioning for mark-to-market (MTM) losses on investments held in Available for Sales and Held for Trading,’’ said in a statement. “The provisioning for each of these quarters may be spread equally over up to four quarters, commencing with the quarter in which the loss is incurred.”

The regulatory forbearance comes after yields spiked in the last two quarters of the fiscal ended March

31. At one point towards in December, bond yields have soared more than 100 basis points, inflicting heavy losses on the bond portfolio of banks. Bond yields and prices move in opposite direction.

But the prices have since risen after the government announced a borrowing programme that was palatable to bond markets. The steepest losses came in the December quarter.

Latest provisioning norms is a change in the RBI’s stance which pushed back requests from the banking industry for leniency in provisioning in January when even the State had to report its first quarterly loss in 17 years for the December quarter.

“Interest rate risk of banks cannot be managed over and over again by the regulator,” Deputy Governor Viral Acharya told a bonds association meeting. “The regulator, in the interest of financial stability, is caught in such situations between a rock and a hard place… Recourse to such asymmetric options – heads I win, tails the regulator dispenses – is akin to the use of steroids.”

Any rigidity in RBI’s stance may have inflicted heavy losses on banks again in the March quarter and the capital the government provided may have been swallowed by provisioning for treasury losses rather than strengthening the balance sheet.

“Spreading of MTM losses does provide some comfort for banks in terms of reducing losses and hence gives a leeway to have benefit towards reported capital numbers,” said Udit Kariwala, associate director, financial institutions, India Ratings & Research. “As per our estimates, a large part of the capital announced under bank recapitalisation programme would have been consumed towards absorbing treasury losses. The benefit is more shortterm and structurally doesn’t benefit PSU banks capital cause.’’ The central bank has also come up with a latest measure aimed at checking erosion of profits in future. “Further, with a view to building up of adequate reserves to protect against increase in yields in future, all banks are advised to create an Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) with effect from the year 2018-19,” RBI said."

The bidding process will be a marked departure from BCCI's conventional closed bid auction model (sealed envelope process) after the Committee of Administrators (CoA) felt that the online bidding is far more transparent method for competitive price discovery.

The media rights will be for a period of five years from April 2018 to March 2023.

The BCCI is selling media rights for three specific categories --i) the Global TV Rights plus Rest of World (ROW) Digitals Rights package, ii) Indian sub-continent Digital Rights package and iii) Global Consolidated Rights package.

For 2018-19 season, the per-match value for the global TV and ROW Digital Rights is Rs 35 crore, Rs 8 crore for Indian sub-continent, and a starting bid of Rs 43 crore for the Global Consolidated Rights.

From the period between 2019-2023, the per-match value package is Rs 33 crore, Rs 7 crore for Indian Subcontinent and Rs 40 crore for the Global Consolidated Rights.

India are expected to play 22 Tests, 42 ODIs and 38 Twenty20 Internationals at home in the next five-year cycle.

Star, Sony and Jio are expected to compete hard for the TV broadcast rights along with Yupp TV while Facebook and Google will be battle for the Digital Rights Package.

With Star, Sony and Jio also expanding their presence in the digital market, it won't be surprising if there are big bids for the Global Consolidated Rights package (which includes both i) and ii)).

Star already owns Indian cricket's most coveted media property IPL having paid a record 16,347 crores for a consolidated global bids that includes TV as well as digital rights.

Star also has ICC tournaments such as World T20 (men and women), men's and women's 50-over World Cup along with the Champions Trophy.

""It will be interesting how desperate Star will be now that they have acquired IPL media rights. Sony, on the other hand will be more desperate for the India Rights as Indian team's media rights are important for any broadcaster's survival. Jio can be the dark horse as winning even the TV Rights will announce their big-time arrival in broadcast market,"" a senior BCCI official tracking the event told PTI.

Facebook had placed a whopping bid of Rs 3900 crore (USD 600 million) for exclusive digital rights of IPL but lost to Star who acquired the rights with a consolidated bid.

While the closed bidding is a one-time process, the e-auction will allow the companies to file incremental bids (with fixed slabs) after each round till competitors pull out of the race. Technically, the e-auction may spill over to the next day if the bidding process is not completed by 6 pm tomorrow.

Sony and Star had expressed unhappiness on BCCI keeping the minimum bid price same irrespective of the stature of opposition. However the board has not budged from its stance as they feel it's a kind of pressure tactic employed by potential broadcasters.

""There are 80 percent matches in this five-year cycle in which India will counter big teams and broadcasters will recover their money. The 20 percent of the matches against weaker teams wouldn't affect their earnings,"" a senior office bearer said."

The lender has come out with a detailed set of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) seeking to address concerns of customers in the wake of the recent fraud.

""In PNB there is zero tolerance towards unethical practices within the system. That is why the minute the bank became aware about discrepancies related to the incident, the fraudulent transactions were immediately reported to the regulator and the law enforcement agencies,"" it said.

PNB said it has reached out to other affected banks and apprised them of the developments.

On February 14, PNB informed exchanges about a fraud to the tune of Rs 11,400 crore involving billionaire jewellery designer Nirav Modi, his family and uncle Mehul Choksi of Gitanjali Gems.

The fraud amount after further probe by the bank now stands at nearly Rs 13,000 crore.

The Modi-Choksi duo managed to generate fake LoUs in connivance with a few bank officials and presented the same to other Indian bank branches overseas to avail credit facilities outside India.

As many as 30 odd banks are affected due to this fraud including SBI, Union Bank, Allahabad Bank, ICICI Bank, among others.

As a fallout of the fraud, touted as the biggest in the Indian banking history, Reserve Bank asked lenders last month to discontinue issuance of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and Letters of Comfort (LoCs) for trade credits.

Further, PNB said it has undertaken measures to strengthen internal audit control mechanisms and looking at technology interventions to enhance customer service and customer responsiveness including automating customer response mechanism.

In response to query on what action has been taken by the bank against its employees involved in the fraud, PNB said the bank is committed to ensuring that no one, irrespective of their level, is spared.

Regarding a query on safety of customer's money, PNB said with a strong balance sheet of Rs 11 lakh core and sufficient non-core assets, it is capable to meet any contingent liability on the bank and ""your money is safe with us"".

The bank registered the case with CBI in February itself. Besides, the Enforcement Directorate is probing the matter at its level."

Waymo, the self-driving car company started by Google, did nothing after an autonomous vehicle run by Uber killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. It didn’t pull back on tests in the nearby suburb of Chandler, where passengers are already taking rides with no one behind the wheel. Its fleets elsewhere didn’t abandon public streets, a precautionary move made by Toyota.

John Krafcik, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo, decided to wait.

“What really brought it home was the Tempe police releasing the video,” he said. He watched the grainy footage of the world’s first self-driving death. Uber’s car barrels down the road, a woman pushing a bicycle crosses into the frame, and neither the autonomous car nor its human monitor acts to slow down. The safety driver appears to be mostly looking away until impact.

For Krafcik, the crash video validated the philosophy Waymo had been following long before he joined, back when it was still part of Google: Never trust humans in cars.

“That just reinforced it,” he told Bloomberg during an interview on March 24 in Las Vegas. Later that day he took the stage at a car dealer convention and went further: If a Waymo vehicle encountered a similar situation, Krafcik claimed, the car would have avoided the death without human help.

“We asked all the hard questions before we deployed,” said Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo’s technical chief, who seconded Krafcik’s assurances of superior safety. That confidence is reflected in Waymo’s continued push in the days after the crash. Krafcik announced a deal last week with a second automotive partner, Jaguar Land Rover, to supply vehicles for the Waymo ride-hailing service slated to launch this year, adding to the existing fleet from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

Waymo is now nearing a final deal with a third automaker, Honda Motor Co., in a move that will test the company’s ability to compete in the $164 billion delivery and logistics market. The delivery focus of the alliance with Honda hasn’t been previously reported. The companies have been silent since announcing talks in late 2016, but results are coming soon.

Krafcik said not to expect the new service to take the form of a “traditional car driven on roads.” His comments suggest Waymo is ready to try co-creating a vehicle from scratch with an automaker rather than modifying existing models, as it has done with Jaguar and Fiat Chrysler. The Honda model may move people and goods, Krafcik hinted; it might be smaller than a truck and could come without a steering wheel or brakes. A Honda spokesman said the companies are “continuing to explore” the relationship.

Making bold safety claims and announcing new partnerships in the wake of the industry’s worst accident yet could come across as tone deaf. It might even seem like a victory dance. Waymo spent the last year suing over Uber’s driverless technology before settling in February, and now that technology is being scrutinized by politicians, investigators, and even Uber’s own suppliers. Can Waymo really be so sure its own technology is impervious to tragic error?

That’s a question Krafcik, 56, will grapple with in his emergence as an important face of autonomous driving. He must now convince an industry and public given another reason to be skeptical of unproven technology undergoing growing pains on crowded roads. The crash serves as a reminder that the infrastructure and knowhow for widespread robot cars remains years—maybe decades—away. Interviews with fourteen people who have known Krafcik over the last three decades depict a journeyman auto executive forced to master a peculiar mix of technical transition and public relations.

“He just has amazing equilibrium,” said James Womack, a longtime mentor who worked with Krafcik at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “He’s the guy for dealing with chaos.”

Krafcik has also become the strongest bet to deliver on a longstanding dream of Google’s founders to birth a multitude of other Googles. That was the idea behind the new Alphabet holding structure introduced by CEO Larry Page a few years ago. Things have sometimes seemed to go backward since then. One Alphabet company, Nest, recently folded back into Google; another housing Google Fiber has pared back significantly.

Waymo, flush with cash and personnel, is often trotted out to investors as the best example of Alphabet’s capacity to produce another colossal hit. It’s set to launch a paid taxi service in Phoenix this year and expand passenger trials to a second city. Some observers credit this first-mover advantage to Krafcik, whose career straddles Silicon Valley and Detroit in a way few can match. But his first three years as CEO have also been marred by a bitter lawsuit featuring allegations of trade-secret theft, dramatic staff defections that sent key personnel to rivals, and the sudden onslaught of just about every car company frantically moving into self-driving research.

Reilly Brennan, an investor and Krafcik friend, compared the decision to take the helm at Waymo in 2015 to Bob Dylan ditching his acoustic guitar in 1965 and anticipating the future. “The evolution is the same as Dylan going electric,” Brennan said. “John is plugged in.”

There are skeptics, even among Krafcik admirers. Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation and a Waymo partner, lauds the company’s tech while questioning the inevitability of robotic ride services replacing car ownership. The assumption of ubiquitous carpools, a staple in every Silicon Valley dream of transportation’s future (and the cash flow projections that go with it), doesn’t sit well with the veteran car salesman.

“You can’t get in this thing with a bunch of strangers,” Jackson scoffed during that recent appearance on stage with Krafcik in Las Vegas, while a crowd of car dealers looked on. The Waymo boss adjusted in his seat and smiled but didn’t respond.

The youngest of eight in what he considers a family of “car nuts,” Krafcik finished college at Stanford University and knew he wanted to make vehicles. His then-girlfriend had a year left in school and that meant Detroit wasn’t an option. He landed a two-year gig at NUMMI, a joint venture of General Motors and Toyota, and studied under Yoshimitsu Ogihara, an engineering manager who Krafcik affectionately calls his “Yoda.”

Krafcik’s next career turn happened during grad school at MIT. He saw a bulletin board posting, in 1986, seeking help with a “global study of automotive practices.” Womack, then the director of the university’s motor vehicle program, was looking for an assistant. “It took me a nanosecond to know this is the guy I need,” Womack recalled.

Krafcik’s background at NUMMI was a natural fit for Womack's project to probe, among other things, why Japanese automakers could churn out cars with better reliability at three times the pace of their American peers. The research didn’t always go over well. On Krafcik’s first visit to a GM plant outside Boston, the floor manager snapped, “Those guys make Jap crap. I make Oldsmobiles. You get that, son?’”

Womack recalled that Krafcik “was a superlative diplomat” and a “slight, lithe, gazelle-like guy” who would bound from plant to plant, collecting data to show how everyone was doing things wrong.

“Eventually,” Krafcik said, “the industry got religion.” He ended up coining the term lean production as a result of his research.

Next, he climbed the ranks at Ford before leaving in 2004 for the insurgent Korean automaker Hyundai. He became CEO of its U.S. operations in 2008, making a mark in the financial crisis with the Sonata. Ads starring Jeff Bridges peddled the model as a low-frills, inconspicuous luxury car.

John Suh, a former colleague now at Hyundai’s venture arm, Cradle, said Krafcik promoted technical add-ons like automatic emergency breaking and remembered him as a “real standout” in marketing. That knack helped fuel growth in the U.S. until sales dipped in late 2013, and Krafcik was gone. Conventional wisdom in the industry links Krafcik’s departure to weak sales, but he insists he had simply exhausted his stay. “There was really no career progression path for an American executive,” he said.

He spent four months as a free agent, fielding offers. A call came from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, now a reliable Waymo foe, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. (Krafcik said he and Musk have spoken before but wouldn't comment further; Tesla declined to comment.)

He took a role as the number two at TrueCar, a website that crunches data to match car shoppers with deals. Depending on who you ask, Krafcik was brought on to be a diplomat with dealers who had turned hostile, massage the automakers involved in rebate programs, or glad-hand investors ahead of the IPO. TrueCar’s stock has returned to the $9 price from its 2014 debut, and Krafcik remains on the board.

TrueCar marked Krafcik’s first foray into a digital firm, and its complicated business forced him to navigate nearly every nook of the car world. Just not autonomy: “Never heard him say anything about it,” said Mike Dunn, TrueCar’s former CTO. “Nobody ever talked about it.”

The Google recruiter came for Krafcik in 2015. Page was scouting an automotive hand for what was then a six-year-old car project. Krafcik took his first ride in Google’s Firefly, a squat prototype he would later eliminate. He reached out to Womack, and the management professor advised caution: He would be committing his career to an effort that demanded unprecedented technical feats, and, perhaps more so, unseen social change.

“Off the 30 meter board,” Womack said, “this is a jump, with a tuck, into a pail of water.” Krafcik started at Google that September.

For his first initiative, Krafcik tried to cut an ambitious deal with a former employer: Ford. The two companies conceived a plan with new self-driving vehicle designs and a multi-year business alliance. The talks collapsed after Mark Fields, Ford’s then-CEO, flew to Google’s headquarters for a dinner with Page where he pushed for a faster timeline, according to a person familiar with the episode.

Krafcik said Waymo walked away because the terms were unfair. “It just wasn’t the right one for us,” he said. “We already had the risk of the technology. We’re also deciding on vehicle formats for years and years and years. There was significant capital risk on our plate, not shared equally.” A Ford spokesman declined to comment.

This was also the moment when Krafick discovered brewing rancor within Waymo. Anthony Levandowski, a founding engineer on the Google self-driving project, had simmering disputes with Chris Urmson, the program’s longtime leader. Krafcik was brought in to “referee a cage match,” a former employee said. Tensions boiled over, and Levandowski left—but not before sending an email to Page that criticized Krafcik and the attempted Ford deal and proposed splintering the car team. (Waymo later sued Levandowski for allegedly taking trade secrets to Uber. The case settled earlier this year.)

A minor victory for Krafcik followed when he scored a deal with Fiat Chrysler. But that celebration was cut short by the August 2016 exodus of Urmson and several early members of the team. Former Waymo employees describe the departures as tremendously dispiriting. Some were also frustrated that partnership talks were all redrawn when Krafcik joined, according to one person, contributing to a sense that business plans were constantly in flux and shaped by pressure from rivals like Uber and Tesla. The former Waymo personnel asked not to be identified discussing a past employer.

Waymo’s spin on these departures is that they coincided with a transition in driverless cars: This was the moment the project moved from its early incarnation as a pure research gambit towards its commercial destiny. In other words, a shift from a Google project to the free-standing business of Waymo. That idea is undercut somewhat by the fact that Urmson and several others who left are now working on self-driving companies with commercial aims.

Jaime Waydo, who runs Waymo’s systems engineering, points to the veterans who stayed, including Dolgov and Andrew Chatham, who runs maps. Even those critical of Krafcik praise his hiring, particularly his deputies Shaun Stewart (head of partnerships) and Tekedra Mawakana (the policy lead).

Krafcik’s boosters see him as a turnaround exec. “He has had to take that organization and get it out of the ditch strategically,” said Eric Noble, an industry consultant at the Carlab. “In a very short amount of time.”

One of Krafcik’s signature tactics is turning to collaborators, something Google has historically spurned. When Waymo’s robot fleet in Phoenix grew beyond its staging warehouse, the team prepared to buy a second building. Krafcik proposed outsourcing instead.

“Everyone’s thinking, ‘Really? A partnership for a depot?’” Waydo recalled. The boss got his way and signed a deal with rental-car firm Avis to manage the fleet.

AutoNation, another partner, is working to extend the life of Waymo’s Chrysler minivans to at least 250,000 miles. After the Ford talks failed, Krafcik shifted strategy to court these sorts of automotive veterans who had become laggards in autonomy. The deal announced last week with Jaguar is an example of this approach. The luxury carmaker hadn’t invested heavily in self-driving research, and so a pact to sell 20,000 SUVs to Waymo by 2020 puts its vehicles on the front lines of automation.

The Jaguar deal makes Waymo’s upcoming fleet significant, but not nearly big enough to create a multi-city taxi service to rival the reach of Uber’s enormous population of human drivers. Tesla and GM are also preparing rival services based on their own technology.

Continuing to find new partners might eventually be a challenge. Despite Krafcik’s charm offensive, carmakers are wary of how much customer experience, data and revenue they want surrender to Waymo. Some have spurned the tech giant, including Hyundai, which opted instead to work with Urmson’s new company, Aurora.

Krafcik said that future deals with Hyundai, Ford and others are all possibilities, and he has talked to companies in China, too. (He said he hasn’t spoken with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi since the settlement of the lawsuit.) He now sees Detroit, after years of fearing Google, feeling less threatened. “Very much so,” he said.

Some onlookers question if Krafcik will be around to see Waymo’s alliances through. “You can’t meet John,” said Noble, the consultant, “and not think he’s someone that would have fun running a carmaker.”

For now, though, Krafcik looks to be having fun running a company that’s resolutely not making cars. On the convention floor in Las Vegas, he spotted a Ford Transit Wagon. It’s a hulking eight-seat model he worked on years ago that looks best suited for shuttling around a troop of Girl Scouts or a military platoon.

Krafcik leaped into the second row and turned to the nearest Ford employee: “Do you have a self-driving version?” The answer was no.

“Coming soon,” Krafcik said with a laugh."

""The top talent goes to developed countries for studying, research and contributing intellectual capital as well as economic value to other countries. An estimated six lakh Indian students are studying abroad, spending over USD 20 billion annually,"" the study said.

Only 16 per cent of the Indian firms carry out any in-firm training themselves, as against 80 per cent of Chinese firms.

The study indicates that only a small portion of Indian graduates are considered employable. The National Employability report 2013 pegged that employability was less than 25 per cent in almost all job functions across education streams- science, commerce, arts etc.

It said India's higher education sector faced many challenges such as low level employability, lack of research as well as limited scope for innovation and entrepreneurship.

""To overcome them it is critical to align the higher education system with emerging economic realities and industry requirements as well as introduce well-structured and futuristic education frameworks,"" it added."
596,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 06:32 PM IST",PTI,Panache,Personal diary of Kennedys' White House nanny to go under the hammer,"BOSTON: The personal diary of the White House nanny during the Kennedy administration, which details the development of Caroline and John Kennedy Jr between 1957 and 1962, may fetch USD 2,800 at an auction.

The diary of Maud Shaw, which contains 22 handwritten pages, covers the emergence of teeth, first steps, first words, illnesses, and a detailed record of their nutritional intake.

With a resume that featured nanny positions in England, Iran, and Egypt, Shaw was hired by the Kennedys in 1957 to care for the newborn Caroline while JFK was still a senator, according to US-based RR Auction.

Regarding Caroline, Shaw notes in July-August 1959, ""Says Da-Da, laughs very loudly, play pat-a-cake.""

Most notably, under the first entry for John, ""born 25th November 1960,"" Shaw notes that he was two weeks premature.

""Weight 6 lbs 3 ozs, slow gaining weight, put on full strength Simalax a Beef, 3 times daily at 4 weeks, I look on John, 28th Feb 1961,"" she wrote.

In March 1962, she notes that John is ""repeating words after me - very well.""

Accompanying the diary are four hand written letters addressed to Shaw by a young Caroline, dated 1965-1967, two of which are postcards, illustrating the warm relationship Shaw shared with the Kennedy children in the years immediately following their untimely departure from the White House.

""Thank you so much for The Finding Out Treasury. It is so good. I read about how Smallpox Vaccination was invented. It was very interesting. I didn't have time to read anything else as I was busy opening presents. John loves his book too,"" Caroline wrote in one letter.

Another letter, postmarked March 26, 1967, says, ""I miss you. We are in Mexico now. It is beautiful!""

A third letter, postmarked January 1, 1966, says, ""Thank you very much for the pink thing (I don't know what to call it) and the picture frame. I have it here in Switzerland.""

Shaw remained in the Kennedys' employ for more than seven years and became one of the most trusted, and evidently adored, adult influences on the closely protected Kennedy children.

Held in such high regard by the Kennedys, Shaw was given her own private quarters in the White House, where she could be reached at a moment's notice.

When the president and first lady were tasked with other matters, Shaw became the fixed parental figure, and it was Shaw who ultimately informed five-year-old Caroline that her father had died.

Shaw detailed her service in the memoir White House Nannie: My Years with Caroline and John Kennedy, Jr, published in 1966.

The bidding for the auction closes on April 11."

The floral displays on the big day will be designed by London-based luxury floral designer Philippa Craddock and will include white garden roses, Diana's favourite, and peonies, which are Markle's favourite.


Harry and Markle would tie knots at St George's Chapel at the Windsor Castle on May 19. The wedding would follow a carriage procession through Windsor town and a reception in St George's Hall, it was announced last year.

Craddock will create the floral displays for inside St George's Chapel where the royal couple will get married, and inside St George's Hall for the reception after the ceremony.

Working with a team of florists from St George's Chapel and Buckingham Palace, the displays will use flowers and foliage taken from the gardens of the royal palaces and Windsor Great Park, the official residence of the British Royal family said.

It is not clear what colour scheme the couple have chosen, but the designs will feature white garden roses in memory of late Princess Diana, peonies and foxgloves, along with branches of beech, birch and hornbeam.

Peonies are believed to be a favourite of Markle's, and pictures posted on her Instagram account suggested Harry may have impressed her with bunches of the flowers when they first started dating.

The Kensington Palace said the arrangements will ""reflect the wild and natural landscapes from which many of the plants will be drawn"".



The Royal Parks will also supply some pollinator-friendly plants from their wildflower meadows, which will provide a good habitat for bees, the palace said.



Craddock, who has a studio in London and shop in Selfridges, said, ""I am excited and honoured to have been chosen by Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle to design and create their wedding flowers.""

""Working with them has been an absolute pleasure. The process has been highly collaborative, free-flowing, creative and fun.

""The final designs will represent them as a couple, which I always aim to achieve in my work, with local sourcing, seasonality and sustainability being at the forefront,"" she said.

Harry and Meghan have decided that after the wedding the flowers will be given to different charities. The couple's lemon and elderflower wedding cake will also be decorated with fresh spring blooms."

Moody’s owned ICRA upgraded the ratings of 646 entities and downgraded that of 418 entities, pointing to an improvement in the credit quality of a larger set of entities. Upgrades as percentage of total rated entities increased to 11% in fiscal year ended March 2018 from 8% a year earlier. Downgrades as a percentage of total rated entities remained at 7%, the same as in March 2017. ICRA rates 6000 entities.

Anjan Ghosh, chief rating officer at ICRA said that though upgrades have been more, rising interest costs means that corporate India is still not out of the woods yet. “Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) has risen just 3% but interest costs are up 6% which means interest coverage ratio for companies has fallen. Working capital debt levels remain elevated because of higher interest costs and an increase in commodity prices,” Ghosh said.

Standard & Poor’s owned Crisil’s credit ratio or the ratio of upgrades to downgrades stood at 1.67 times better than 1.22 times reported in the last fiscal. There were 1,402 upgrades to 839 downgrades in fiscal 2018. Crisil has ratings outstanding on around 12,500 issuers.

Crisil describes India’s credit landscape as a tale of two loan books – the good one, which is improving, and the bad one, with sizeable stressed assets ( around Rs 11.5 lakh crore, or 14% of bank advances as on March 31, 2017) where resolution has begun.

Credit ratio in sectors linked to consumption, investment, and exports did better benefiting from improving demand after and , benign and implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendation by states. Upgrades outnumbered downgrades in the good loan-book due to lower capital expenditure and record Rs 1.75 lakh crore of equity issuances.

“However, the banking sector remains burdened by high NPAs. We expect the stock of NPAs to peak in the current fiscal year which means banks will be able to focus on credit growth and operating profitability,” said Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director, Crisil Ratings. The rating agency expects the gross NPAs of banks to peak to at 11.5% of gross loans sometime in fiscal ended 2019 around 11% currently."

Generic adoption reaching saturation levels and regulatory overhang along with base effect catching up were also cited as the major challenges impacting growth.

The agency said while the demand prospects from domestic market are likely to remain healthy given increasing spend on healthcare along with improving access, regulatory interventions, especially relating to price control and mandatory genericisation remain a concern.

Icra said the revenue growth from the US during FY12-17 period witnessed a CAGR of 19.3 per cent, though the growth came down from 14.4 per cent in FY16 to 4 per cent in FY17 and the trailing 12 months growth is 16.2 per cent, despite consolidation benefits.

Gaurav Jain, vice-president, Icra said the growth momentum is likely to face further pressures going forward, led by limited near term first to file (FTF) generic opportunities, pricing pressures and product rationalisation for US base business.

""Besides increased regulatory scrutiny, consolidation of supply chain in the US market resulting in pricing pressures along with sustained investments in R&D will also have an impact on profitability of domestic pharmaceutical companies,"" he added.

As for the domestic formulations business, the agency said the growth rebounded to 10.3 per cent and 7.6 per cent in September and December quarters, respectively, compared with 8.8 per cent in the June quarter due to recovery in trade channel stock post GST implementation.

The move follows Securities Appellate Tribunal's (SAT) directive to Sebi for passing the final orders in the matter by March this year.

The markets regulator had conducted an investigation into the dealings of the First Financial Services Ltd (FFSL) stock as it observed abnormal movement in the price and trading volume of the scrip on BSE from May 15, 2012 to March 31, 2014.

Following a rapid rise in the international rates to which local prices are linked, diesel is selling at record rates in the country and petrol at four-year peak. On Monday, diesel was sold for Rs 64.69 per litre and petrol for Rs 73.83 a litre at Indian Oil outlets in Delhi.

Petrol and diesel prices have gained Rs 10.74 and Rs 11.36 per litre respectively in the last nine months in which crude oil has gained $21.87 per barrel to about $70/barrel.

Heavy duties imposed by the Centre and states is key to petrol and diesel being so expensive in the country. In Delhi, petrol bear about 100% and diesel 69% levies comprising excise duty and VAT, according to the latest data published by the Oil Ministry’s petroleum planning and analysis cell.

“There can be no knee-jerk reaction on economic policies,” Pradhan said on demand for tax cuts to bring down fuel prices for consumers while arguing that fuel taxes were needed to fund development work. He also defended market pricing mechanism for petrol and diesel.
“For consumers to get rational price mechanism, the petroleum products will have to be brought into the GST mechanism,” he said, without elaborating how inclusion in GST will make petrol and diesel cheaper.

The highest rate of tax applicable to products under GST is 28%. Since fuel sale is a major source of revenue for states as well as Centre, it’s difficult to imagine them agreeing to cut rates sharply on petrol and diesel.

Petrol, diesel, natural gas, crude oil and jet fuel are currently not included in GST."

Even though the constituency elected George (for two consecutive terms), who went on to win Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's trust and become a powerful minister, the constituency is battling issues that range from rise in crime rate to infrastructure gaps.

The locals ET spoke to say some of their problems are irregular supply of piped water, clogged storm water drains, floods during rains, broken waste management system, high crime rate and lack of women safety.

“We get water twice a week. Sometimes even that does not happen. Most of us depend on borewell water but that’s contaminated. This is the problem throughout the year and it’s worse in summer,” says George KX, president of Hennur Ballari road (HBR) resident welfare association.

Mix of urban poor and rich
The Sarvagnanagar assembly segment, which came into existence from 2008, consists of 3.34 lakh voters and eight BBMP wards. They are: Nagawara, Banaswadi, HBR Layout, Kammanahalli, Lingarajapuram, Kacharakanahalli, Kadugondanahalli and Maruthisevanagar.

Once a sleepy residential suburb, these localities saw rapid urbanization after the construction of Outer ring Road and its proximity to tech firms and international airport. Some of the areas are cosmopolitan in nature and is home to multi-brand outlets, educational institutions and high end restaurants.

Issues:
With a lot of migrant population, most of whom are from foreign countries, the residents of Kammanahalli fear rampant drug trafficking, chain snatchers, and women safety. In wards such as Banaswadi, HBR Layout and Lingarajapuram, it’s the shortage of water and inconsistent garbage collection that‘s making a lot of noise.

The residents of remaining three wards -- Kacharakanahalli, Kadugondanahalli and Maruthisevanagar, which has a large chunk of urban poor population, are in need of basic civic amenities. Even the portion of Nagawara and Kadugondanahalli rank poor in infrastructure development.

Prithvi Reddy, convener of Aam Aadmi Party in the State, and a candidate from the segment, promises action if elected.

“The past MLAs and the corporators did nothing for residents. Building Hennur flyover took nine years and cost went up five times while the authorities have no ideas as to how they can ease congestion at Mukunda theatre flyover,” he said. “The area below Lingarajapura flyover has turned out to be a garbage dump and public toilet,” he added.

Politics:
While KJ George has been winning from the constituency twice with a ticket from Congress, the BJP has not been successful in giving a good fight in the assembly elections. despite having three representatives in the BBMP council. With AAP and SDPI putting their candidates in the 2018 elections, the contest is going to turn even more interesting."

It was a happy coincidence for Dhoni as he was conferred with the prestigious civilian honour on the seventh anniversary of their famous World Cup triumph.

The Indian Territorial Army had conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel to Dhoni on November 1, 2011, months after the country lifted its second World Cup under his leadership.

The 37-year-old Dhoni is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honour.

As his name was announced, Dhoni marched past the dignitaries present at the Rashtrapathi Bhavan before receiving the honour from President Ram Nath Kovind.

A lot like his batting in his heyday, Dhoni looked pretty much at ease as he walked towrds the dais wearing the army uniform.

Also conferred with the Padma Bhushan was multiple world title holder cueist Pankaj Advani.

On this day in 2011, India won the World Cup final against Sri Lanka.

With 10 balls to go at the Wankhede Stadium, the then-captain Dhoni ended India's 28-year wait with a massive six.

Dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007 and the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour in 2009.

Like Dhoni, Advani also has a distinguished career, having won gold twice at the Asian Games in 2006 and 2010."

The fund will be used to enter Singapore or the US market by end of the year.

The investors included Sudarshan Narayan, MD Amplifi and Clark & Kent, Amitava Neogi ED & COO of Centrum Wealth, Vishnu Bhat promoter Blue Neem and ex-Infosys Global head of cloud, Rajiv Lunkad & Sanjog Lunkad promoters of PDR Electronics, Siddharth Sood CEO AG Acoustics, Ajay Kotkar founder-director of Arges Global and cofounder of Startup Buddy.

The Pune-based company, which was part of Amplifi SaaS Accelerator second cohort of startups with a Unified Communication product, launched its earlier POC version at the end of the program in 2017. However, detailed user feedback indicated that there was a more niche, more underlying yet larger problem that they wanted solved.

The co-founder & CEO of Keito said, “Based on what our potential customers (POC users) were telling us, we decided to listen really hard and go after a really narrow problem. However, if we solved it well, then it would tackle a bigger headache for our customers across the widest swathe of regions and verticals. The possibilities are unbelievable. Hence we decided to do a product pivot”.

The funds received in the seed round will be utilised to super-refine the original product and launch the new proof of concept (POC) in Singapore or the US by end of 2018 or early 2019. “At that point we will be looking to raise a large pre-series or series A round either in Singapore or the US”, said Sudarshan who is also actively involved in product development and fund raising.

“Despite a market crowded with the terms AI, ML etc, Keito is exciting because of the narrow focus of the use case while at the same time having much wider applications. You could call it a generalised AI with deep functional expertise”, said Vishnu.

Adds Amal “That’s exactly why we are going stealth - we are focusing on launching a IP centric start-up at the same time we want to stay away from getting lost in the white noise. We will let our product speak for itself.”

Keito is founded by Amal PS and a co-founder who will be joining full time in four months. Amal has worked with Edgeverve /Infosys and was a part of the wearable team in Edgeverve. Keito's other Co-founder has worked with multiple 's and has experience in global product delivery of large scale enterprise applications."

622,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:14 PM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,"Siddaramaiah to contest from JD (S) stronghold; counting on consolidation of Dalits, Kurubas, minorities","A 750-kg garland made of apples was brought by a crane to the campaign vehicle at Hootagalli that carried Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah around in Chamundeshwari assembly constituency, where poor roads and drainage system presented a stark contrast to most other parts of the poll-bound state.

“I have come here ahead of the official announcement of my candidature as I won’t have time to come later. You must consider yourselves Siddaramaiah and work for my victory,” said the CM, admitting that he was visiting the constituency after 12 years.

Announcing himself as the Congress candidate from the constituency, the star campaigner responsible for the party’s performance in all 224 constituencies in the state told an uproarious crowd, “I have come back to you all. My party will form government again and I will continue to be the CM, if you people bless me.”

Pointing to the crowd, most of who were crunching on the apples from the garland now,

Siddaramaiah told ET: “They are all Vokkaligas. But they have come for me.”

His campaign managers, however, said that they were not counting on the 71,000-odd Vokkaliga votes but on consolidation of an estimated 45,000 Dalits, 50,000 Kurubas and 14,000 minorities in favour of the CM.

Chamundeshwari is an acknowledged stronghold of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (S). Since 2006, the Vokkaliga community that appears to revere the former PM and his son, HD Kumaraswamy, has been upset with former JD(S) state president Siddaramaiah for going against them. Siddaramaiah belongs to the Kuruba (shepherd) caste which is considered lower in the social hierarchy.

At Gungral Chatra, the village of Siddaramaiah’s opponent and sitting MLA, GT Deve Gowda of the JD(S), villager Maade Gowda told ET: “Who will vote for Siddaramaiah? We want Kumaraswamy as CM. He is the only one to have done anything good for the state.”

Siddaramaiah has, however, ignored the advice of his close advisers and picked up the gauntlet to fight the May 12 assembly polls from Chamundeshwari. “The JD(S) has challenged me. I want to end my active political career in this constituency, which I first represented as an independent. But I also want to show them I can win here without them,” he said.

His opponent, GT Deve Gowda, who was Siddaramaiah’s campaign manager earlier, appeared equally confident. “I will defeat him without any problem,” he said.

Siddaramaiah has represented Chamundeshwari five times since 1983, as an independent and Janata Party, Janata Dal and Janata Dal (S) candidate respectively. He lost twice here, in 1989 and 1999. “Both times, it was because my party split,” he said.

He won a high-voltage by-election in 2006 after stepping down as deputy CM, by a mere 257 votes. It was the first and the only time he contested here as a Congress candidate. “It was the toughest election I have ever faced,” he told ET, between hailing party workers and old faces in the crowd. “There was no demonetisation (to control cash flow). Both the JD(S) and the BJP, who were jointly ruling the state, ganged up to defeat me. But the people of Chamundeshwari held my hand and I won.”

In 2008, Chamundeshwari’s boundaries changed. Siddaramaiah shifted to the new, neighbouring Varuna constituency, named after a canal he had funded as finance minister that supplies Cauvery water to this otherwise arid region. He won with huge margins in 2008 and 2013, even as Varuna is dominated by BJP’s chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa’s Lingayat community.

This time, Siddaramaiah’s son Yathindra is tipped to contest from Varuna. And the BJP may throw a tough challenge by giving the party ticket to Yeddyurappa’s second son Vijayendra, a political novice like Yathindra.

“Both these constituencies are safe seats,” Siddaramaiah said. “I know the voters, many of them by name. They will stand by me.”

However, several areas that voted for him in 2006, including his village of Siddaramanahundi, have gone to Varuna.

There are also one lakh urban voters in the constituency and of the five wards in Mysuru city, two are represented by the BJP.

Many voters belonging to the dominant castes also complained of the CM’s “visible bias” towards other backward castes and Dalits.

Gayathramma at Yaachegowdanahalli pointed to concrete roads in the Dalit part of the village and said, “Our roads and drains are not done, only theirs are. Let them vote for him, why should we?”

But the mutual animosity between the Lingayats and Vokkaligas could help him, as is evident in Dadadakallahalli village. Lingayats here, like Shankara, are unhappy with Yeddyurappa, not bothered about Kumaraswamy and praise Siddaramaiah. “Can you see how much work he has done for the state? And for poor people like us?” he asked.

Former Chamundeshwari MLA M Satyanarayana, who is working overtime to campaign for Siddaramaiah, said that women across communities would vote for the CM. Vijaya in Chatradahalli endorsed this, saying, “Siddaramaiah gave us food for five years for free (though the public distribution system under the Anna Bhagya scheme). How can we not vote for him?”

But there are other factors at play as well. Yashoda, in Gungral Chatra, said, “GT is from this village. Satyanarayana is from our neighbouring village. How can we choose between them? One vote will go to each of them from our house.”"
623,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:16 PM IST",PTI,Energy,Govt rules out excise duty cut to cushion petrol prices,"The government today ruled out any immediate reduction in excise duty to cushion relentless rise in international oil prices that have sent retail diesel rates in India to record high and petrol to four-year high.

The BJP-led government had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.

Asked if a second round of excise duty cut was in offing, Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said: ""Not as of now. Whenever we review it, we will let you know"".

Earlier in the day, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the government is keeping a close eye on international prices but said there is no going back on free market pricing.

He said consumers will benefit if petrol and diesel are brought under Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime at the earliest.

Petrol price today hit a four-year high of Rs 73.83 a litre, while diesel rates touched an all-time high of Rs 64.69 in the national capital on rising international oil rates.

""India needs market pricing to provide oil to all,"" Pradhan said at an event organised to mark the launch of Euro-VI grade petrol and diesel in the national capital.

Fuel pricing is based on a transparent mechanism, he said, attributing the spurt in rates to happening in international market. ""When crude oil prices rise, naturally consumer feels a pinch,"" he said.

""We are concerned (about the impact on consumers). We are keeping a close eye on the developing international oil scenario,"" he said.

He, however, did not offer any hint of a government intervention like cutting excise duty to give relief to consumers.

""Centre and state bank on tax revenues to meet developmental needs. 42 per cent of collections from excise duty (on petrol and diesel) goes to states and out of the remaining 60 per cent is used to fund centre's share in development schemes in states,"" he said.

Pradhan said the GST Council - the apex decision making body of the new indirect tax regime - should in the ""interest of energy security and consumers"" include petroleum products in GST.

Petrol, diesel, natural gas, crude oil and jet fuel (ATF) are currently not included in GST, which essentially leads to producers not being able to set-off tax paid on inputs from final tax on product.

The government, he said, had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre in October and some states had followed it up with a reduction in VAT (value added tax).

""When there is a pricing issue, states should respond and cut VAT,"" he said.

State-owned oil firms, which have been since June last year revising auto fuel prices daily, today raised petrol price by 10 paise per litre and diesel by 11 paise.

Petrol in the national capital now costs Rs 73.83 a litre, the highest since September 14, 2014 when rates had hit Rs 76.06. Diesel price at Rs 64.69 is the highest ever, with previous high of Rs 64.22 being on February 7, 2018.

India has the highest retail prices of petrol and diesel among South Asian nations as taxes account for half of the pump rates.

The government had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016.

Subsequent to that excise duty reduction, the Centre had asked states to also lower VAT but just four of them -- Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- reduced rates while others including BJP-ruled ones ignored the call.

The central government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in October 2017, when petrol price reached Rs 70.88 per litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 59.14. Because of the reduction in excise duty, diesel prices had on October 4, 2017 come down to Rs 56.89 per litre and petrol to Rs 68.38 per litre. However, a global rally in crude prices pushed domestic fuel prices far higher than those levels.

The October 2017 excise duty cut cost the government Rs 26,000 crore in annual revenue and about Rs 13,000 crore during the remaining part of the current fiscal year.

The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices. In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government's excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.

State-owned oil companies -- Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation -- in June last year dumped the 15-year old practice of revising rates on the 1st and 16th of every month . Instead, they adopted a daily price revision system to instantly reflect changes in cost. Since then, prices are revised on a daily basis."

In an order, Sebi said ASEL has substantially complied with the conditions for its exit as per the regulator's framework and therefore 'is a fit case to allow exit'.

Sebi has said the exchange complied with the regulator's exit norms and made payment of necessary dues to the regulator, including 10 per cent of the listing fee and the annual regulatory fee.

While Kohil succeeds CP Joshi, party in-charge of Bihar, Singh takes over from Ambika Soni who had been requesting her workload be reduced. These are the first organizational assignments for both of them and they fit into the middle rung at the party leadership as “AICC in-charge of states”, a slot below AICC general secretaries and a notch above the attached AICC secretaries

Both Joshi and Soni continue as AICC general secretaries with the former still having over half a dozen states under his charge, while the latter is in charge of J&K. Yet the removal of Joshi from Bihar, known to be among the ‘handpicked guides’ of Gandhi, is significant as the Gandhi-Joshi were the architects of three boomeranged acts; propped up Nitish Kumar as the face of the now defunct mahagadbandhan only to see him realigning with the BJP. The duo had also backed PCC chief-turned-party deserter Ashok Chowdhary despite in-house rebellion against him.

Kohil, who is a senor Congress leader from Gujarat and a close associate of Ahmed Patel, is a vocal critic of PM Modi and BJP. An AICC spokesperson, Kohil lost the last Assembly polls.

631,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 08:43 PM IST",ET Online,Politics,Why Congress and the BJP are in overdrive on Bharat Bandh by Dalits on SC/ST issue,"NEW DELHI: Bharat Bandh, the protest organised by the Dalit community across the country today over a recent Supreme Court order on the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, is not just another protest that would die down in a few days. It has serious long-term ramifications for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well as the Congress. That's why both the parties are leaving no chance to criticise each other over the Dalit issue.

Why the Dalits are protesting
On March 20, the Supreme Court banned automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. It said public servants could not be prosecuted without the approval of the appointing authority, and private citizens too should be arrested only after an inquiry under the law. It further diluted the stringent clause of the law by ruling that a preliminary inquiry in a case under the Act would be conducted by a senior official to ensure the allegations are not frivolous. The changes in the law are meant to protect honest public servants from being blackmailed with false cases under the Act.

Why it's not a routine protest
Bharat Bandh by the Dalit community has spread all over the country. It's not the kind of protest that would fizzle out shortly. It has the potential to galavanise the whole community as the SC/ST Act was considered by the community a potent protection against caste discrimination. The community sees the Supreme Court ruling as a serious dilution of Dalit rights. Taking away a strong protection can create a long-term grievance in the community. The protests may stop after a point but the community will not forget the issue.

Why it's a challenge for PM Modi
After initial reluctance, the government today moved a review petition challenging the recent Supreme Court order. However, it may still have to face the criticism for something which is not of its own doing. The government has filed the petition days after the ruling and sharp criticism from several Dalit leaders, a few of them from the BJP too. After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has come to rely on Dalit votes to win elections. Prime Minister Modi's own backward-class background has helped it change its image of an upper-caste party. A permanent grievance will alienate the Dalits from the party at a time when it faces elections in several states with considerable Dalit votes and the Lok Sabha elections after an year.

Why it's a godsend for the Congress
With the Karnataka assembly polls taking place within two weeks, the Dalit protest will give the Congress a huge boost. If the problem is not solved quickly, it will certainly turn the Dalit voters away from the BJP in an assembly election which has become a battle of prestige. The Congress is expected to make big gains from offering minority status to the Lingayat community, which traditionally votes for the BJP. Alienation of Dalit votes will further mar the BJP's chances in this election. That's why the Congress is trying to position itself on the right side of the Dalits on this issue. Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted this on Bharat Bandh: ""Thousands of my Dalit brothers and sisters have come out on the streets to demand protection of their rights from the (Narendra) Modi government. We (Congress and I) salute them."" Rahul also tried to blame the BJP and the RSS for the Supreme Court ruling: ""Keeping Dalits at the lowest rung of Indian society is in the DNA of the RSS/BJP. Whoever dares challenge this position is suppressed with violence."" The BJP has accused the Congress of playing politics with BR Ambedkar, the father of the Indian Constitution.

Resurgence for BSP?
Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which had faced rout at the hands of the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections last year, can find an opportunity to revive itself if it's able to channelise the Dalit anger in its favour. The present issue can help Mayawati brand the BJP as an anti-Dalit party, something she had worked very hard to do but not with much success so far. If the issue lingers on, it can also help Mayawati consolidate her position among the Dalit voters while the BJP becomes less attractive to BSP leaders wanting to cross over to the party after the BSP's alliance with its old rival Samajwadi Party."

633,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 09:54 AM IST",ET Bureau,Startups,Zomato posts 45% growth in FY18 revenue at USD 74 mn,"MUMBAI: Online food delivery and restaurant discovery firm Zomato has clocked about Rs 481crore ($74 million) in revenues for FY18, CEO Deepinder Goyal claimed in a blog post. Zomato maintained it grew revenues in FY18 by about 45% from $51million last year even as it managed to keep up its profitability flag flying across all geographies. “We demonstrated that our business can generate profits — almost throughout the year, we hit EBITDA breakeven globally, across all our business, and while maintaining good growth levels; and then in the last two months, we decided to doubledown on growth,” wrote Goyal.

These numbers for FY18 are unaudited and may see some changes when the audited report is submitted. Zomato clocked Rs 309 crore (about $47 million) in revenues in FY17 as per financial documents filed with the registrar of companies and accessed by business research platform Tofler.
While the company did not make mention of the performance in losses, it highlighted a slight reduction in operational burn to about $11million compared with $15 million in FY17. A significant part of this operating burn — about $6 million — was incurred in February and March alone, after Zomato raised $150 million in funding from Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba’s payment affiliate Ant Financial. The two months of February and March had witnessed a 40% growth in revenues, Goyal had tweeted last month helping the firm reach an annualised revenue run rate of $100 million (Rs 650 crore) as of March 2018, ET had reported.

A large part of the growth has come from the online ordering and subscription-based businesses for Zomato in FY18. Online ordering now forms about 30% of the overall revenues, growing from the 19% share it had in FY17. With online ordering now available in 20 cities across India and the UAE, Zomato claims to have hit 5.5 million monthly orders in March alone across both geographies with about 60% of the deliveries fulfilled by its in-house delivery fleet through the acquisition of hyperlocal delivery firm Runnr last year. As of 2017, its main rival Swiggy was clocking over 4.5 million monthly orders but the latest numbers were not available.

The subscription services including Zomato Treats and Gold have provided the much needed fillip to Zomato’s attempt at diversifying its revenue base as it takes on Swiggy in an extremely competitive food technology market in India. The firm has about 1,20,000 users across Treats and about 1,60,000 across Zomato Gold with the latter forming almost 12% of its revenues within 3 months of its launch.

Zomato clocked revenues worth Rs 60.7 crore in online ordering in FY17, forming about 19% of its business last year.

However, a focus on online ordering and subscription services has seen its once-core business of advertising struggle to grow significantly. While the business has grown 20% in revenue in FY18 with 15,000 restaurants paying for ads, the advertising sales team has shrunk by 20%, Goyal wrote.

Revenues from advertising stood at Rs 180.7 crore in FY17 forming about 58% of the revenue pie, down from the 75% it formed in FY16."

The funding is expected to come in four tranches, as per the MCA filings. Currently, Alibaba along with Alipay holds 57% stake in Paytm Mall. However, after the fourth tranche of financing concludes, SoftBank Vision Fund will hold 21% and Alibaba (with Alipay) will hold around 46% stake in the ecommerce company.

“This latest investment led by SoftBank and Alibaba reaffirms the strength of our , growth trajectory, execution capability and the potential of India’s massive O2O (online-to-offline) model in the retail space,” said , COO, Paytm Mall. “The funds will be deployed to empower the shopkeepers with technology, building superior logistics, strengthening the Paytm Mall brand and bringing an enriching experience to the customers.”
Alibaba did not respond to queries sent by ET at the time the story went to press. For SoftBank, the investment comes after the Japanese telecom and internet giant put $1.4 billion in Paytm last year.

“The SoftBank Group is excited to continue supporting Paytm as it develops into one of the leading internet ecosystems in the country. Our investment in Paytm Mall is part of that ongoing commitment. We believe Paytm Mall’s offline-to-online operating model, combined with the strength of the Paytm ecosystem, is uniquely positioned to enable India’s 15 million offline retail shops to participate in India’s eCommerce boom,” said a SoftBank spokesperson.
SoftBank’s new interest in ecommerce space comes after the Japanese multinational conglomerate led a funding round in India’s largest ecommerce player Flipkart in 2017. However, SoftBank is expected to dilute its shareholding in Flipkart with talks of Walmart making an investment in the online retailer, making the Paytm Mall investment a way to diversify its bets and compete against Amazon India.

Paytm Mall has been making inroads into the Indian ecommerce market, replacing Snapdeal as the third largest player after Flipkart and Amazon India. The company claims to have exited FY18 at a gross merchandise volume (GMV) run rate of $3 billion and is targeting an ambitious $10 billion run rate by end of this fiscal. According to the MCA filings, Paytm Mall is expected to close FY18 with a loss of around Rs 1,013 crore, which shot up from just Rs 13.6 crore in FY17.

Paytm Mall focuses primarily on its online-tooffline model which drives almost 60% of its overall sales through its partnership with 75,000 stores. The company plans to triple its offline presence by end of 2019."

However, the government has missed its ambitious target of Rs 10.05 lakh crore as per the revised estimates set in the Budget for 2018-19.

CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra said that as per data collected so far, tax collections for 2017-18 is Rs 9.95 lakh crore, which is 17.1 per cent higher than net collection of 2016-17. The Budget estimate for the 2017-18 fiscal was Rs 9.80 lakh crore.

""We have already crossed the BE and we are in process of getting the Revised estimates because these are provisional figures as of today and more collections are likely to come,"" he told reporters here.

Asked if the revised estimates of Rs 10.05 lakh crore from direct tax collection was too aggressive, Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said, ""We should always try to be more aggressive when it comes to targets"".

""I hope this Rs 9.95 lakh crore will reach up to more than Rs 10 lakh crore. At least next 3-4 days, we will get adjustment of Rs 5,000 crore. It will be a landmark if we achieve Rs 10 lakh figure in current year,"" said Adhia, who is also the Revenue Secretary.

The growth rate for net collections for corporate income tax is 17.1 per cent and the same for personal income tax (including STT) is 18.9 per cent.

As against 5.43 crore ITRs filed during FY 2016-17, in 2017-18 as many as 6.84 crore returns were filed, a growth of 26 per cent. Of this, 6.74 crore returns were e-filed. Between March 30 and 31, the last day of fiscal 2017-18, 56 lakh ITRs were filed.

""This was because of continuous follow up by our department. We have issued large number of SMS, emails on the basis of data with us. Because of which new returns have come and around Rs 13,000 crore of self assessment tax has come in last two months because of continuous follow up by the department. In non-intrusive manner, we have intimated to the assessees about their assets, properties and that's why they have filed returns,"" Chandra said.

Giving comparative figure of number of returns filed, Chandra said the figure for 2017-18 shows a growth of 80.5 per cent over 3.79 crore ITRs filed in 2013-14.

Chandra said the number of assessees added during the fiscal is around a crore, which is a very good achievement by the department and government's emphasis that more persons should come into the tax net.

Adhia further said that the government will meet the 3.5 per cent fiscal deficit target for 2017-18 as broadly direct and indirect collections are in line with expectations and there have been some savings on expenditure."

We expect a quiet start to the trade and see some consolidation in the initial stage. It would be important to see if the Nifty takes supports near the 10,180-mark, while it faces possible consolidation.

Agencies

The levels of 10,245 and 10,320 are likely resistance area for the market on Tuesday. Supports will come in at 10,180 and 10,135 levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is 46.3027, and it continues to remain neutral against the price showing no divergence. The daily MACD has reported a positive crossover, and is now bullish while trading above its signal line. We had mentioned this possibility in our previous note. A white body emerged on the candles.

The pattern analysis shows that the Nifty has attempted to move past the 10,180-mark, which was its 200-DMA, and it also coincided to be the important pattern resistance area for the market. Though this has not been significantly breached on the upside, the likelihood of the continuation of the upmove definitely remains.

Overall, we may see some minor consolidation and then Nifty continuing the pullback, which it had started after defending the crucial 10,040-mark.

Having said this, we reiterate to continue making select purchases with each consolidation or a minor correction. We will continue to see select outperformance from select stocks sprinkled over few sectors. Cautious optimism is advised for the day.

STOCKS TO WATCH: Stocks like Hexawere, CG Power, Hind Zinc, Vedanta NSE -0.71 %, Indiabulls Real Estate, TATA Power NSE -0.15 %, Jamna Auto, Bombay Dyeing NSE 0.05 %, NBCC and Trident will continue to see a relatively bullish technical setup.

The UP Government, in a proposal to hire a consultant for this task, has said this will be a change in its tourism strategy so far which focussed on individual destinations like the Taj Mahal or Varanasi, that happens to be the Prime Minister's constituency. ""Given the rich and diverse tourism assets of UP, till date, the State has primarily focused on promoting tourist attractions such as Taj Mahal or individual destinations like Varanasi. It has yet to develop a thematic route or circuit, which includes various sites and activities as part of an integrated tourism experience that entices tourists to allocate more of their time
and expenditure across the state. The state government would like to test such approach by developing its Buddhist heritage and sites as part of a larger thematic route, moving from promoting sites to enabling a more active journey through the footsteps of the Buddha in its multiple sites as cultural and pilgrimage route,"" says the proposal.

Mayawati' party has so far laid claim on Lord Buddha so far, with new districts like Siddharthnagar and Gautam Budh Nagar being carved out in her regime as Chief Minister. The Yogi government is now proposing developing six Buddhist destinations - Sarnath, Kushinagar, Sravasti, Sankisa, Kaushambi and Kapilvastu - as a circuit as well as their linkage with Bodhgaya in Bihar for ""unifying it as a cultural and pilgrimage route and tourist product."" The UP government has also handed over a large tract of land to take forward the work to build a very large bronze statue of Maitreya Buddha in Kushinagar. The six destinations in UP are spread over as many districts, namely Varanasi, Kushinagar, Kaushambi, Siddharth Nagar, Sravasti and Farrukhabad. ""The Buddhist sites in UPare currently promoted in isolation. There is a need to develop it in a way that brings together various historical sites and activities, besides meditation and prayer. Even within the spiritual realm, the Buddhist sites in the state lack a narrative, this draws upon Buddha’s journey and self-discovery,"" the proposal mentions.

The consultant will prepare a Comprehensive Tourism Development Master Plan for the Buddhist Circuit which will mainly include improved infrastructure like upgradation/new construction of stay facilities and basic amenities (toilet, drinking water, electricity, waste management) for the benefit of tourists and local communities alike. Improved transportation services like air, train, bus, taxi for the benefit of tourists and local communities and improved protection and interpretation of the destinations’ main monuments and sites as well as natural landscape and assets is on the state's priority list."

Led by the sharp fall in the stock, the company's market valuation eroded by Rs 10,452.84 crore to Rs 1,68,344.16 crore on the BSE.

The shares of the lender took a beating amid controversy following reports about alleged involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon Group on quid pro quo basis.

Markets regulator Sebi is looking into the matter for any possible disclosure and corporate governance-related lapses.

With regard to revenues from the Goods and Services Tax, the collection is 98 per cent of the Rs 4.44 lakh crore target set in revised budget estimates.

""On the whole, this year has been very good in spite of the fact that it was a year of uncertainty for revenue because of GST introduction. But still both in direct and indirect taxes revenues, we have broadly met our target and we are very much on course to achieve our fiscal deficit target.

Astronomers routinely study galaxies much farther away, visible because they glow with the brightness of billions of stars. They also managed to study supernova, often brighter than the galaxy in which it sits.

However, for a distance of about 100 million light years, the stars in these galaxies are impossible to make out individually.

But a phenomenon called gravitational lensing, the bending of light by massive galaxy clusters in the line of sight, can magnify the distant universe and make dim, far away objects visible.

The single star was discovered in NASA Hubble Space Telescope images taken in late April of 2016 and as recently as April 2017.

""You can see individual galaxies out there, but this star is at least 100 times farther away than the next individual star we can study, except for supernova explosions,"" said Patrick Kelly at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the paper's first author.

These observations can provide a rare look at how stars evolve, especially the most luminous ones.

""For the first time ever we're seeing an individual normal star - not a supernova, not a gamma ray burst, but a single stable star - at a distance of nine billion light years,"" said Alex Filippenko, a professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley and one of many co-authors of the report.

The B-type star Icarus is much larger, more massive, hotter and possibly hundreds of thousands of times intrinsically brighter than our Sun.

According to the researchers, an extended lens, like a galaxy cluster, can only magnify a background object up to 50 times, but smaller objects can magnify much more.

A single star in a foreground lens, if precisely aligned with a background star, can magnify the background star thousands of times.

In this case, a star about the size of our sun briefly passed directly through the line of sight between the distant star Icarus and Hubble, boosting its brightness significantly.

Also, if the alignment was perfect, that single star within the cluster turned the light from the distant star into an ""Einstein ring"": a halo of light created when light from the distant star bends around all sides of the lensing star.

The ring is too small to discern from this distance, but the effect made the star easily visible by magnifying its apparent brightness.

The astronomers predict that Icarus will be magnified many times over the next decade as cluster stars move around, perhaps increasing its brightness as much as 10,000 times.

660,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 11:20 PM IST",PTI,Visa and Immigration,US begins H-1B visa application process,"WASHINGTON: The US today started accepting applications for H-1B visas, considered as the most sought-after work visa among highly skilled Indian professionals, amidst unprecedented scrutiny by the Trump administration.

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which is the federal agency responsible to process the visas, started accepting applications for H-1B visas for the fiscal year 2019, beginning October 1.

The USCIS had earlier indicated that there will be zero tolerance by it for even minor errors.

As of now, the USCIS has not indicated if it plans to go for a computerised draw of lots as has been the case in previous years after receiving several times more than the Congressional mandated cap of H-1B visas.

A leading advocacy group representing the tech industry including Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook said that it expects number of H-1B petitions to reach the Congressional mandated caps in coming days. As a result of which the USCIS would again resort to a computerised draw of lot to determine successful applicants, it said.

""Within a few days we expect that the H-1B visa lottery will reach the annual cap, as it has for the past six years, highlighting the overwhelming demand for this visa category,"" FWD.us president Todd Schulte said.

The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The H1-B visa has an annual numerical limit cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year as mandated by the Congress. The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries with a US master's degree or higher are exempt from the cap.

""There are many ways in which our immigration system is broken and in need of comprehensive reform; fixing our legal and high-skilled immigration system, including protecting the H-4 rule and eliminating country caps for green cards, will ensure the US can maintain our global competitive advantage,"" Schultz said.

Observing that immigration has always been a source of strength for America's economy, Schultz said H-1B visa is a ""key part of the high-skilled immigration"" system that needs to be reformed to allow the United States to remain the centre for global innovation.

""We should make it easier for the best and brightest to come from around the world while also cracking down on bad actors,"" Schultz said, voicing his concern over the recent move to tighten the H-1B application approval process.

""H-1B visa holders create jobs and raise wages for native-born Americans by bringing their ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit to the science, engineering, and tech sectors, creating American jobs and benefiting thousands of businesses and countless communities across the country,"" he said.

""Reforming and expanding high-skilled immigration is an important part of a broader fight to protect legal immigration avenues,"" Schultz said.

Ahead of the H-1B visa filing process, the USCIS had said this work visa should help US companies recruit highly-skilled foreign nationals when there is a shortage of qualified workers in the country.

""Yet, too many American workers who are as qualified, willing, and deserving to work in these fields have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged. Employers who abuse the H-1B visa program may negatively affect US workers, decreasing wages and opportunities as they import more foreign workers,"" it had said."

The bench had in its last hearing on March 27 observed that the application filed by Binani Industries — offering full repayment of dues to all creditors of its cement arm following a separate deal with UltraTech NSE 2.20 % Cement — was in the “larger interest of all creditors”.

The lawyer representing the lenders’ panel on Monday told NCLT that the company had not submitted details of the repayment proposal. Also, the lenders were unable to obtain the NCLT order suggesting out-of-court settlement due to public holidays, the lawyer said.

On being asked by the bench if CoC would want to consider the proposal if it got a copy of the order, the counsel sought time to consider the application. “Now that the ball is back in CoC’s court, we hope the issue will soon get resolved and we will not have to fight long for our rightful dues,” Binani Operational Creditors Forum (BOCF) spokesperson Hitesh Bindal said after Monday’s hearing.

According to the agreement between Binani Industries and UltraTech, the former would sell its 98.43% shareholding in the cement business to the Aditya Birla Group company for Rs 7,266 crore. This deal was outside the ongoing resolution process in which Dalmia Bharat-led consortium was selected as winning bidder by CoC. The lenders had rejected UltraTech’s bid. Binani’s agreement with UltraTech provides Binani Cement’s six lenders — including five public sector banks and one asset reconstruction company —the prospect of bettering the debt recovery deal for the insolvent company."

This follows serious concerns raised by domestic vehicle manufacturers citing China-based BYD’s large scale of operations and access to low-cost funds and subsidies from Beijing. BYD’s joint venture with Goldstone Infratech won most of the recent tenders for supply-own-operate contracts for e-buses.

ET was the first to report on March 22 that and have bagged nine of 10 contracts, leaving competitors like Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and JBM Solaris empty-handed. The winning bids placed by the two companies were nearly 30% lower than the market price. Ashok Leyland bagged a contract for 40 e-buses in Ahmedabad.

“We are in talks with state transport undertakings. They have told us that the opex model is good for them since the corporations do not have the wherewithal to run and maintain these . We are finding mechanism to figure out costs of the e-buses,” the official said.

Of the 10 contracts, five have been tendered on outright purchase model and the remaining on supply-operate-maintain model. Of the five won under the operate basis, three have been won by BYD-Goldstone Infra for supply of 230 buses in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Tata Motors has won the contract for 40 buses in Jaipur and Ashok Leyland for another 40 in Ahmedabad.

Goldstone-BYD placed bids as low as Rs 29.28 per km for a 9 metre AC bus to Bengaluru, followed by Rs 36 per km bid for a similar variant for Hyderabad. Tata Motors won a similar contract in Jaipur with Rs 70 per km bid. The Centre is evaluating the per bus cost in such cases to derive subsidy outgo, the official said.

The Department of Heavy Industries had in December 2017 sanctioned Rs 440 crore to 11 states for procurement of electric buses, electric taxis and e-autos as a pilot project under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles scheme that offers up to 60% subsidy on procurement subject to a maximum of Rs 1crore."

On average, 27.5 km of highways were constructed every day in FY18, while contracts were awarded for an average 46 km per day, a top road transport and highways ministry official said. The construction of 10,000 km of national highways last year compares with 8,231 km in FY17 and 4,260 km (11 km per day) in FY14, the last year of the UPA government. Contracts were awarded for 17,000 km in FY18 compared with 15,848 km a year earlier and 3,169 km (8 km per day) in FY14. The government on Tuesday will officially announce the numbers achieved in FY18 and the targets for FY19.


The total investment in constructing national highways by both the government and private investors was about Rs 1.5 lakh crore, of which almost Rs 1 lakh crore came from budgetary allocation, ploughing back of toll collections and borrowings by the .

In FY19, the expenditure on national highways is likely to exceed Rs 2 lakh crore, of which about Rs 1 lakh crore will come from extra-budgetary resources (including borrowings and monetisation of existing national highways) and more than Rs 70,000 crore through budgetary grants and tolls.

The ministry implements its national highways development programme through NHAI, the National Highways & Development Corporation and state public works departments.

NHAI is the single largest agency for implementation of national highways – it constructed more than 4,000 km in FY18 and awarded 150 projects of 7,400 km worth Rs 1.22 lakh crore, the highest ever.

NHAI Chairman Deepak Kumar told ET there was a huge increase in the size of contracts awarded in FY18.

The length of road projects awarded by NHAI was 4,335 km in FY17."
666,"Last Updated: Apr 02, 2018, 11:46 PM IST",ET Bureau,Economy,IBC update proposals to be sent to Law Ministry,"NEW DELHI: The government will soon seek the law ministry’s opinion on amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) suggested by a high-level committee and may move an ordinance to make urgent changes.

The 14-member insolvency law committee headed by corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas made a presentation on its final recommendations to the Prime Minister’s Office on Thursday.

The draft bill is likely to be shared with the law ministry soon and thereafter it will be sent for cabinet approval, a senior government official told ET. “If there are any pressing issues that need to be addressed urgently, then the government will consider promulgating an ordinance.”

The number of cases in insolvency courts is rising and some issues require clarity, which may push the government to issue an ordinance. Parliament has barely functioned in the second leg of the budget session, which started on March 5 and ends this week.



In November, the government issued an ordinance aimed at preventing wilful defaulters from regaining control of companies with banks being forced to swallow loan losses. The bill introduced later in parliament eased some of the norms such as allowing a promoter to submit a resolution plan if dues are cleared before making a bid.

Subsequent working of the IBC has revealed more shortcomings and the government set up the committee to address them. Provisions requiring urgent attention include more clarity on ‘related party’ and ‘connected persons,’ which are seen as harsh and disqualifying many bidders.

The committee has proposed changes to Section 29A dealing with ineligibility to ensure that only those who contributed to the downfall of the corporate debtor or were unsuitable to run the company because of their antecedents – directly or indirectly – are disqualified.

The committee suggested easing insolvency rules for small enterprises and providing relief to home buyers by treating them as financial creditors.

It said persons who enter into any backdoor arrangement with corporate debtors formally or informally, directly or indirectly, should be barred from bidding for an insolvent company by bringing them within the scope of the definition of connected persons.

It suggested that a case admitted for resolution can be withdrawn if 90% of the creditors agree, implying that unsuccessful bidders could get back in the reckoning for an asset with a better deal.

The committee was in favour of widening the scope of IBC so that entities such as housing finance companies, which are not regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and are declared non-performing assets by another financial sector regulator, should also be barred under Section 29A.

A person who is a promoter or a related party in any such company will also be disqualified from bidding for insolvent companies.

The committee has now been wound up and will meet only to discuss the issue of cross-border insolvency."

The higher filings allowed the government to meet the direct tax collections target for the financial year and almost reach the slightly higher revised numbers for the year.

“The increase in total returns filed and new returns filed during FY 2017-18 is a result of sustained efforts made by the Income Tax Department in following up with potential non-filers through email, SMS, statutory notices, outreach programmes, etc. as well as through structural changes made in law and the government’s emphasis on widening of tax net,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes () said in a statement.

The number of new income tax filers increased 99.49 lakh in 2017-18, 16.3% more than 85.52 lakh added in the previous fiscal.

“There has been a sustained increase in the number of ITRs filed in the last four financial years. As compared to 3.79 crore ITRs filed in FY 2013-14, the number of ITRs filed during FY 2017-18 (6.84 crore) has increased by 80.5%,” the statement said.

A recent study carried out by HR services firm PeopleStrong predicts the automobile industry to hire 8-12% more employees in fiscal 2019 than this year.

Maruti Suzuki NSE -0.18 % and Tata Motors NSE -0.15 %, India’s top two vehicle makers, will together add as many as 4,500 employees in the next fiscal year starting April to deal with their growing product portfolio and sales.

Tata Motors, India’s largest automaker by revenue, is set to add around 1,500 white-collars employees, including campus hires, and another about 2,000 blue-collar workers in functions such as technology, engineering, sales, customer care and manufacturing, said Gajendra Chandel, chief human resources officer. Maruti Suzuki will hire about 1,000 people in FY19, a top company official said. “We were holding back some of this hiring as we have been going through our transformation programme as well as driving productivity improvement,” said Chandel.

Over the next two-three years, the company is looking to hire 2,500 white-collar employees, including the 1,500 it plans for fiscal 2019, he said. Most of the 2,500 bluecollar workers it plans to recruit will come on board in the next year itself. The headcount addition includes replacement against natural attrition and retirement. “Maruti Suzuki has outpaced industry in growth…In line with the growth, momentum and buoyancy there is an uptick in hiring too,” said a company spokesperson.


Last year, the hiring at Tata Motors was largely for replacement, but this year it’s much higher and incremental in order to manage growth, said Chandel.

The bulk of the hiring will be at entry levels. However, there will be opportunities in niche areas across the middle and senior levels as well.

“Hiring at the leadership level and middle-management level may be very limited as we have put in place a robust succession planning process,” Chandel said, adding that most of the recruitment would be at the entry and juniormanagement levels.

“Automotive is one of those sectors which seems to be on the way to revival as far as hiring intent is concerned,” said Pankaj Bansal, the chief executive at HR company PeopleStrong.

A bulk of the hiring will be concentrated in the research and development (R&D) segment with a lot of it happening in areas of design, engine and fuel side. The R&D segment will see a 12-15% increase in fiscal 2019 in hiring, according to the PeopleStrong study, titled India Hiring Intent. “There will be increased opportunities in manufacturing, engineering and other emerging areas,” said Stephen Sudhakar, senior vice president–administration at Hyundai Motor India, the country’s second-largest carmaker.

Rajeshwar Tripathi, the chief people officer at Mahindra & Mahindra, said new recruitment would be more based on talent and skill with the company looking at new skills largely in the area of digital.

“Focus on electronics and metatronics is going up in manufacturing and mechanical is coming down a little,” he said, adding that the company was hiring people in digital and technology from startups and sectors such as consumer durables.

Nissan, too, has seen an increased demand for talent in automation and digital space. “In order to achieve our future business objectives, in the next two-three years we are looking at hiring around 5-8% per annum in middlemanagement and leadership positions across functions such as product planning, quality, CRM, sales and digital,” said Jayakumar David, the director for human resources at Renault-Nissan Alliance India."

Analysts expect the momentum to continue in the new financial year, as economic activity is improving as well.

Cumulative domestic vehicle sales growth in the past year was 13-15%, according to estimates based on data shared by industry players, hitting the double-digit mark for the first time since fiscal 2012. The two-wheeler, three-wheeler and commercial vehicle segments have each posted record double-digit growth, despite uncertainty over the implementation of and transition to new emission standards. In passenger vehicles, the industry is projecting a high-single-digit expansion for fiscal 2018.

The local two-wheeler market is estimated to have crossed the 20-million-unit milestone, with sales growing 14%, helped by strong demand in the rural areas after good rains last monsoon. The three-wheeler output (domestic and exports combined) likely ended the year close to the 1-million mark, with growth of more than 25%.



The commercial vehicle segment, seen as a barometer of economic activity, is estimated to have recorded sales of over 8.8 lakh units in the past fiscal year, growing 23% from the year before, with medium and heavy vehicles eclipsing the previous peak posted in FY12. Industry executives cited the introduction of GST, which resulted in free movement of goods, and other policy changes for the strong performance. The passenger vehicle segment is expected to have expanded 8% with sales of about 3.3 million units. Subrata Ray, senior group vice president at ratings firm , said there was clearly pent-up demand for two-wheelers and commercial vehicles after demand disruptions due to and then from the implementation of GST and new emission regulations.

“The deferred purchase of FY17 was consummated in FY18 and that is reflecting in the numbers. We expect the growth momentum to sustain in FY19 across segments. We forecast passenger vehicles to grow by 9-11%. However, with the high base effect of two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, the growth rate may slip slightly,” said Ray. India has been an outperformer among leading global automobile markets in calendar year 2017.

According to data from OICA, a global dealer body, with sales of 32,27,701 units, India remained the fifth largest market for passenger vehicle sales globally, trailing China, the US, Japan and Germany. Industry observers expect the country to overtake Japan by 2020.

India had overtaken China as the largest motorcycle market in 2016.

In calendar year 2017, demand for passenger vehicles grew the strongest in India (by 8.8%) after Iran (20.6%) and Brazil (10%). In commercial vehicle sales, India at 12.4% grew the fastest after China’s 13.9% expansion. VE Commercial Vehicles managing director told ET that the CV market would likely report a new peak, led by strong replacement demand and addition of new fleet due to strong infrastructure activity. “Ban on overloading, increased investment in infrastructure and efficiency improvement in load carrying, especially by the ecommerce segment… has created fresh demand for new trucks,” Aggarwal said. “If not for multiple disruptions, the peak could have been recaptured much earlier.”

The Kishore Biyani-owned retail chain claimed that prices of about 1,500 stock keeping units at its Big Bazaar stores will be the lowest in the country, benchmarked against online and brick and mortar rivals.

“We have built system and sourcing efficiencies which will help us price products better,” Biyani said. “Our non-food portfolio is almost 60% and we want to focus on food products now which will be through our own brands and discounted national brands. It will help acquire new customers and also increase frequency of existing customers,” he said.



In past years, most retailers, including Big Bazaar outlets, drifted to shaving weekly prices on a short-term basis before raising them again.

Markdowns in Big Bazaar will now be consistent throughout the year, and will further go up if rivals try to match it, the company said.

The first round of discounting will be in the range of 6-30%, it said.

The strategy at nearly 280 Big Bazaar outlets will result in additional Rs 2,000 crore savings for consumers annually, the company said.

Biyani pioneered supermarket discounting in the country over a decade ago but it still mostly revolves around national holidays.

The move is seen as Biyani’s most aggressive attempt yet to take on rivals such as Avenue Supermarts’ D’Mart and Reliance Retail as well as online players Amazon and Flipkart that have started selling grocery on their marketplace.

“These are tactical moves and it’s like taking the bull by the horn,” said Harminder Sahni, founder of retail consultancy firm Wazir Advisors. “They may be seen as a value format retailer, but they want to improve on the perception to that of a retailer that sells for the lowest price. Such kind of cart comparison is quite common in the US,” he said.

Food and grocery account for almost 50% of the overall retail basket in the country. Although online penetration is still less than 1%, it has high growth potential.

Edited excerpts:

You have forecast that automation will displace millions of jobs over the next 20 years. How does that augur for India where we have to create employment for so many people?
India has a big advantage because of its wage arbitrage. In Germany, the cost of a factory worker per hour is thirty times the cost in India. Even cobots or robots cost about $4 per hour. In India, the average factory worker gets paid less than $2 per hour. It’s an area that you can capitalise on for growing manufacturing.


Both global corporations and private equity firms view this as a booming market. Population growth is negative in many parts of the world. China’s population growth has plateaued. India is the only significant market where population is growing creating a large pool of unserved and underserved consumers.


The has created more billionaires than the IT services space in India. This demonstrates India has the ability to be competitive in manufacturing. Its consumer base can potentially attract a lot of companies to make in India for India. This can reduce reliance on imports.

Additionally, with government policy support, India should target areas like technology and artificial intelligence based applications as sectors to build expertise.


It’s a big opportunity. IT services reflected India’s potential in the area of technology and internet is the next wave of opportunity. China has capitalised on this by creating global businesses such as Alibaba. They now have access to data across consumer sets in different markets.

They can use it to create artificial intelligence based applications. In India, you have the same opportunity. is now a national player. But can it develop a larger footprint. That’s the opportunity to target. And this requires policy support from the government."

The spacecraft, packed with 2,630 kg of research, crew supplies and hardware, was lifted off on Monday from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, Xinhua news agency reported.

About ten minutes later, the second stage engine has burnt completely and ""Dragon confirmed in good orbit,"" according to SpaceX's official twitter account. Then, solar arrays have been deployed ""right on schedule,"" NASA confirmed.

Grapple and berthing to the space station is targeted for Wednesday before the spacecraft spends approximately one month attached to the station, returning to Earth in May with some results of completed experiments, NASA says.

Flight Engineers Norishege Kanai of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, backed up by NASA astronaut Scoot Tingle, will supervise the operation of the Canadarm2 robotic arm for Dragon's capture, according to the agency.

After the capture, ground commands will be sent from mission control in Houston for the station's arm to rotate and install it on the bottom of the station's Harmony module, NASA says.

This flight will deliver scientific investigations including a study on severe thunderstorms on Earth, on the effects of microgravity on production of high-performance products from metal powders, and food growth in space.

The spacecraft also carried cargo for testing effects of the harsh space environment on materials, coatings and components; identifying potential pathogens aboard the station and investigating an antibiotic-releasing wound patch.

The petition, filed in the Delhi High Court, alleges that though the licence deed of the commercial tower is identical to those of the World Trade Centre and World Trade Tower adjacent to Hotel LaLiT, Delhi, the commercial tower’s occupants are being treated differently.

“While sub-licensees of World Trade Centre continue to enjoy their property, the commercial tower is being singled out for arbitrary actions,” stated the petition filed by advocate Dil Jit Singh Ahluwalia.

The petition further alleges that CJ international, the operator of Le Meridien, has paid Rs 432 crore as licence fee compared with nearly Rs 48.84 crore paid by Bharat Hotels, which runs the LaLiT, in 33 years, even though the licensed area of is 6.0485 acres with 550 rooms as against 4.29 acres and 350 rooms of CJ International.

“Arbitrary actions have violated fundamental rights of the petitioner. Petition prays that inter alia a writ of mandamus be issued directing respondent one to follow the procedure prescribed as per law and treat all sub-licensees similarly situated, equally, without favouritism, nepotism, whims and caprice, rather than treating the sub-licensees of commercial tower as children of a lesser god,” the petition stated. is respondent one in the petition.

The commercial tower in Le Meridian has 98 occupants and houses offices of companies such as Reliance Industries, Saab India Technologies and BAE System India. NDMC had earlier claimed the commercial tower was sub licensed to various parties by CJ International without the civic body's approval.

Earlier, in September last year, NDMC had carried out the sealing of the commercial tower. Ahluwalia, one of the sub-licensees, had filed a writ petition and the court directed NDMC to de-seal the premises forthwith, leaving it open to NDMC to issue a show cause notice to each of the sub-licensees and, thereafter, take proceedings in accordance with the law.

NDMC issued a fresh eviction notice on January 10 to the sub-licensees to vacate the premises within seven days, after which Ahluwalia filed a writ petition challenging the order.

Ahluwalia has stated that he was offered purchase of sub-licensing rights in both commercial tower and World Trade Centre and World Trade Tower for “valuable consideration” but chose the former. NDMC had permitted CJ International to use the balance area, apart from 350 rooms, for commercial purposes. He also stated that the sub-licensing agreement of CJ International had been approved by NDMC, as seen in letters of CJ International to NDMC in 1998."

“Cambridge Analytica has sought time for another week to respond to the government’s notice,” said the official requesting anonymity.

Last week, the government had also issued a notice to Facebook seeking details of whether the personal data of Indian voters and users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica or any other entity. It has also sought details on whether the data had been used to manipulate the Indian electoral process. Facebook has been given time till April 7 to respond to the letter by MEITY sent on March 28.

In its earlier notice issued to Cambridge Analytica, the government had sought details on whether they have been engaged in any assignment to utilise data of Indians from the above cited breach.

The notice to Cambridge Analytica had also sought an immediate response on which entities engaged it for such assignments, how it came to be in possession of such data, whether consent was obtained from the individuals concerned, and how such data collected was used. It also threatened legal action against companies and individuals who have misused information and sought to influence elections.

Products,Army seeks FMCG help to clean up canteens,"Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Rawat sought the help of consumer goods companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Nestle and Diageo to help stamp out corruption at the Canteen Stores Department (CSD), the single largest customer of consumer goods companies in the country.

“Over the years, there has been some problem with the functioning of our canteen services. Our officers in uniform, at times, indulged in some malpractices and some friends in business partners have supported them,” Rawat told top company executives at a vendor meet in Mumbai on Monday.

“We would want support from business partners to ensure that anybody in uniform who was indulging in malpractices in whatever manner is brought to book.”

CSD, also referred to as the , said it posted sales of Rs 18,000 crore in FY18 through its outlets. It accounts for 5-7% of India’s consumer goods market.

A parliamentary panel had come down heavily on the Army in 2011 for not allowing the audit of unit-run canteens (URCs) while taking note of malpractices in ration supplies for the troops. CSD sought to clean up its act in 2012 by getting rid of the middlemen who were allegedly charging commissions from the companies for getting their goods on to the shelves at the canteen outlets, according to industry executives.

Rawat said CSD has been told to implement a foolproof system and called on the companies to cooperate in this endeavour.



“While we are trying to operate in a transparent mechanism, (we need) your support in this venture of ours,” Rawat said at the meeting in Mumbai.

“We assure you that we will take anyone to task no matter if it’s in the highest headquarters, in the regional centers or in the depots. Any kind of malpractice will not be allowed to flourish in the defence services,” Rawat said.

Putting the CSD’s entire retail system online and automating it would help detect any wrongdoing, said M Baladitya, chairman of the board of administration at CSD.

“Automation is on top of my agenda as that is the answer to all the problems that we face, be it inventory, or visibility and transparency of orders,” Baladitya said at the same event. “If some wrong decisions are taken, it will leave behind an audit trail. Today there is such a big fog that we don't know what is happening and people are misusing their powers.”

He said CSD sales weren’t affected by the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) on July 1last year.

Several companies had said that CSD destocking ahead of this had affected their earnings.

“Our sales last fiscal was almost untouched by GST,” Baladitya said.

“There was a disruption for two months but that was more than overcompensated after Diwali.”

CSD’s operating margin is 1%, which Baladitya said was the lowest for any retailer in the world, adding that it booked an additional.`1,100 crore in profit in FY18 through long-delayed value added tax (VAT) refunds from several state governments and penalties from companies that breached fair-pricing agreements. This included extending CSD matching promotional offers given to other retailers.

Baladitya has been seeking partnerships in terms of logistics, data analytics and stocktaking, even from other retail organisations, he said.

CSD outlets sell products ranging from biscuits and beer to shampoos and cars to 12 million consumers--personnel of the army, navy and air force, ex-servicemen and their families.

The government is also confident of meeting the revised fiscal deficit target for FY18 following improved direct and indirect tax collections. February GST collections rose to over Rs 89,264 crore, up from Rs 88,047 crore in January. It ruled out any cut in excise duty to ease the recent spike in fuel prices.

“E-way rollout has been successful —there is no glitch so far,” finance secretary said on Monday. A total of 28.9 million eway bills were generated on Monday against 25.9 million on Sunday, the first day of the nationwide rollout of the framework that’s expected to help check tax evasion.

The e-way bill system had collapsed when it was first introduced in trials in February, forcing the government to defer its implementation. In the first phase, have been introduced only for interstate movement.

Adhia said the system has the capacity to take on additional load and the rollout schedule for the intrastate movement of goods will be announced soon.

The e-way bill is a kind of permit for the transport of goods exceeding Rs 50,000 in value. It provides details of the items being transported and where they’re headed. It is generated using the GST Common Portal by registered persons or transporters moving the goods. Just before its rollout, the government had announced new rules making the process easier besides providing a few relaxations.

“Hourly rate for generation of e-way bill is 60,000 per hour… We are also prepared with higher capacity,” said GSTN chairman Ajay Bhushan Pandey.

He said a total of 1.12 million taxpayers have registered on e-way bill portal and 20,057 transporters have enrolled.

Pandey said 100 agents are available on call to attend to queries of users. Separately, state tax authorities have also set up help desks in local languages.

Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY India, said the system will face further tests in the coming days.

“Day two of the e-way bill portal was largely smooth. But the real load test is still to be seen as the volume of e-way bills generated on day two as well were low because of year-end procedures like stock counting,” he said. “Also, the department has deployed anti-evasion squads for checking e-way bills, which if it becomes too frequent would entail undue bottleneck in the movement of goods.”


Adhia said the government will meet the fiscal deficit target for the year.

“This was a year of uncertainty, but we have met both direct and indirect taxes collections estimates and we will be meeting the fiscal deficit target for the year,” Adhia said.

Economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg tweeted: “With almost all of revenues and expenditure accounted for (some minor accounting adjustments remaining), I can confirm that both fiscal deficit and revenue deficit are lower than the revised estimates for 2017-18.”

The fiscal deficit target for FY18 was revised to 3.5% of GDP from 3.2% estimated initially. The fiscal deficit of Rs 7.15 lakh crore for the April-February period was 120.3% of the budgeted target for the current fiscal year, prompting concerns that the target may not be met.

The government has exceeded the Budget estimate for direct taxes collections at Rs 9.95 lakh crore and is hopeful of meeting the revised estimate of Rs 10.05 lakh crore as more data on tax deposits pour in, said chairman Sushil Chandra.

Adhia said the government would be able to meet the indirect tax target as well with GST collections on track.

“GST collections have been on the upswing,” Adhia said.

The government has so far collected Rs 7.18 lakh crore in the August-March period as per revised numbers besides Rs 27,811 crore collected as integrated GST and cess on imports in March. GST was rolled out on July 1.

The finance secretary said final GST collection numbers are typically better than provisional ones, which don’t reflect total collections as some revenues come in later.

February GST collections are up from Rs 85,174 crore in the first estimate. GST refunds of 17,616 crore have been given till now. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs had carried out a special drive to clear pending GST refunds of exporters in the fortnight ended March 31.


The government ruled out any immediate reduction in excise duty to cushion the rise in international oil prices that have sent retail diesel rates in India to a record and petrol to a four-year high.

Asked if a second round of excise duty cuts was in the offing, Adhia said: “Not as of now. Whenever we review it, we will let you know.” The government had last cut excise duty in October by Rs 2 per litre."

703,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 06:37 AM IST",ET Bureau,Money,"Seed funding dries, but gush of early & mid-stage infusion","Venture capital funding is seeing early signs of a turnaround with deals into early- and midstage startups picking up pace as risk-capital investors hunt for the next big winners in sectors such as financial technology and digital media.

Capital deployed across series A, B and C funding into startups surged 73% year-on-year to $850 million in March quarter, and the number of deals rose 30% to 76, show data from Tracxn.

Venture capital investors are moving aggressively to close deals as they see interest from global strategic investors such as China’s Tencent and Alibaba and South Africa’s Naspers for follow-on investments. This, in turn, is attracting new financial investors to the market.

But angel and seed funding for startups at idea and product market-fit stage continued its precipitous fall, dropping 45% to 112 deals in the March quarter, as fewer startups are being formed. This may lead to a scenario of hyper-funding and inflated valuations again, where a few firms attract a disproportionate amount of capital, fear investors.

For now, though, it’s mostly companies that have been able to show growth (without relying on discounts) and a path to breakeven or profitability that are attracting capital, unlike in 2014 and 2015, said a dozen investors and entrepreneurs ET spoke with.

The online food-delivery segment is likely to see its two main players, and Zomato, raise multiple rounds of financing this year as the space continues to see healthy growth in the number of orders. ET reported last week that Swiggy was in talks with US Coatue Management and other investors to raise another round of funding, weeks after raising $100 million from South African media giant Naspers and China’s Meituan Dianping in February.



“The markets are certainly warm if not hot. But within it there are good opportunities,” Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk said in an interview last month, adding that his company was scouting for more opportunities in India. “We invested in Swiggy recently… the valuations are significant but we believe the upside is tremendous.”

A similar scenario is likely to play out in fin-tech, especially in online lending platforms, as well as digital media companies catering to the next lot of Internet users in the vernacular space.

The turnaround comes as India’s most-valued Internet companies — online retailer Flipkart, online payments and financial services player Paytm, and ride-hailing platform Ola — have enjoyed investor attention in the past 12 months. This, coupled with profitable share sales in startups by existing investors that have given exit-starved VCs respite and reason to come back to the market.

The revival of VC interest is cyclical, said experts. Top VC firms such as SAIF Partners, Sequoia Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and Matrix Partners had pulled back from seed deals in 2016 and most of 2017 after the slowdown in the market at the end of 2015. At the same time, seed stage-focussed firms like India Quotient, and Kae Capital continued to invest.

“The outcome of that is there is now pent-up demand for series A deals. At the same time, there are seed-funded companies that are now showing product market-fit,” said Shubhankar Bhattacharya, partner at Kae Capital.

Another factor driving the deal flow is that some of the country’s top investment firms including Sequoia, Matrix, Nexus, Lightspeed Partners, Kalaari Capital, Blume Ventures and are on the road to raise more than $2 billion for their new investment vehicles, ET reported in February.

But even as there is plenty of capital, there might not be enough companies to fund. The number of technology startups launched dropped for the first time in five years to 1,000 in 2017. In 2016, 1,400 startups had set up shop, said a report by Nasscom and Zinnov last year.

“Everyone has capital but there are not enough deals in the market. So good deals in the market are getting done really quickly,” said the managing director of a venture capital firm who did not want to be identified. “At the series B stage, deals are happening at a rich valuation because there are so few good deals. Even at the series A level, valuations are lower than 2014 and 2015, but not much lower at about 20%.”

However, entrepreneurs say that the investor community, particularly those waiting to sign later-stage cheques, are continuing to evaluate deals at a far slower pace as compared to the hey days of 2013-15. But at later stages, there is a rush among big investors to back winners even if some of these companies do not need additional capital.

Case in point is PolicyBazaar. The Gurgaon-based online financial services company closed $77 million funding in October at a valuation of about $500 million. The company is also profitable and has taken significant market leadership against rivals. But less than six months after, it is in talks with Japan’s SoftBank to raise a much larger funding round, ET reported last week quoting sources.

“What we are probably in is a cycle that is leaning towards maturity. Investors are looking at some level of delivery and execution rather than just promises,” said Yashish Dahiya, CEO of PolicyBazaar. “At this moment, there is a lot more capital available than there are opportunities to deploy that capital.

What was happening 2-3 years ago was a sten-gun approach, where investors first deployed capital and thought about it later. That has slowed down.”"

Soon after both of them were summoned by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in relation to the probe in Mehul Choksi's Gitanjali Gems fraud, other reasons emerged for their distress. Incidentally, both of them built their initial career at ICICI Bank NSE -0.34 %, known as the talent factory of the banking sector.

Chanda Kochhar
The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a preliminary enquiry to probe alleged nexus between Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot. Though Chanda Kochhar herself is not named in the inquiry. CBI sleuths are ascertaining the veracity of accusations against Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar that Dhoot provided crores of rupees to NuPower Renewables, a firm promoted by Deepak Kochhar, six months after Dhoot's group got Rs 3,250 crores as loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. The said amount was part of a loan of Rs 40,000 crores which Videocon received from a consortium of 20 banks led by the State Bank of India. ICICI Bank has defended Chanda Kochhar, denying allegations of favouritism, nepotism and quid pro quo in loans given to the Videocon group. Dhoot too has denied all allegations. The alleged scam was brought to light by a whistle-blower.

Kochhar is no ordinary banker. She is credited with steering ICICI Bank through one of its worst crises during the global financial crisis after the fall of Lehman Brothers when there was a run on the bank. The finance minister and the regulators also had to intervene during that period to assure customers. Kochhar received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Carleton University, Canada in 2014, in recognition of her pioneering work in the financial sector, effective leadership in times of economic crisis and support for engaged business practices.

Kochhar, who succeeded KV Kamath after his 13-year tenure as chief executive, tore up the very ICICI structure she grew up with, and laid a new foundation. “There comes a point where you have to say that we have to take action,” Kochhar told ET in an interview. “As I was growing up in the system, I was seeing all the positives of the system. Being a part of the whole system has its advantage of being able to see both the sides.”

Kochhar was conferred with the Padma Bhushan in 2011. She has been listed for seven consecutive years in Forbes’ ‘World’s 100 Most Powerful Women’ and for five consecutive years in Fortune India’s ‘Most Powerful Women in Business’. She was also named in TIME magazine’s ‘100 Most Influential People in the world’ in 2015

If a quid pro quo between the Kochhar family and Videocon is proved, it will be a permanent stain on Kochhar's reputation.

Shikha Sharma
In July last year, Axis Bank reappointed its chief executive and managing director Shikha Sharma for three years from June 2018. It was her fourth three-year term. Now the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the Axis Bank board to reconsider her new term, according to an ET report today citing unnamed sources. Reasons include the bank’s performance and its deteriorating asset quality. The board is now considering a one-year term for Sharma, during which it will look for a successor says the report.

When Sharma was appointed Axis Bank's MD & CEO in 2009, its chairman and CEO PJ Nayak resigned well before the end of his tenure. He was sore at the appointment of an outsider. Sharma was managing director and CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

But Sharma pushed aggressively for growth, which helped her build the business. After succeeding Nayak, she acquired Enam Group’s investment and broking business, propelling Axis to the top position in equities advisory and mergers and acquisitions.

Compared with other major banks, Axis has delivered handsome returns since 2009, the year Sharma took charge. It has delivered 256% returns compared to that of 136% of ICICI Bank and 510% of HDFC Bank. ""Sharma changed the bank's hierarchical culture, strengthened the core team by appointing new talent where needed, sought to build its core processes and infrastructure, and filled several gaps in its business portfolio,"" says a report in the Harvard Business Review.

But now Axis Bank has been sliding for quite some time. It has seen a spurt in non-performing assets (NPAs) by 336% in the past three years. The bank, which reported gross NPAs of Rs 1,173 crore at the end of December 2009, saw them jump to Rs 25,001 crore at end of December 2017. Gross NPA ratio, which was at 1.08% in 2009, is now at 5.28%."
705,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 06:12 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,Data or neta: Why big data is of little use when it comes to elections in India,"So, if we are to believe loud political rhetoric and even louder news television programmes, some people, including ‘foreigners’, armed with ‘sophisticated digital technology’ have subverted and/or will subvert India’s democracy.

Rubbish. The big data/subverted elections claim is as fundamentally flawed as Congress’ and other Opposition parties’ claim on rigged electronic voting machines (EVMs). Let’s rescue some key facts from the blizzard of political and media sound bites.

First, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica (CA) controversy is about user privacy and dodgy ways of collecting personal data. That’s a matter of policy regulation, not electoral process. Whether tech giants that depend on advertising revenue generated by loose privacy controls can find another business model, if regulation makes data hoovering tough, is a crucial question. But that’s not related directly to elections.

Second, if firms such as CA are, indeed, willing to provide cash and other equally attractive inducements to subvert elections in various countries, that’s not a matter of big data, but old-fashioned election corruption. Outfits that don’t use data analytics are also guilty of such practices.

Third, fake news riding on social media networks owned by tech companies that want news-driven advertising but don’t want editorial responsibility is also a problem, a big one. But that, again, isn’t directly and solely an election process problem. It is another, larger regulation issue for tech giants to face up to.

Fourth, and related to third: are we seriously going to argue that before social media, election campaigns didn’t see dodgy, dangerous untruths being peddled as facts? And that voters are so gullible that rubbish circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp groups will mostly determine voting decisions? Now, with these facts rescued from fake views, one major question remains: is micro-targeting and voter profiling through data analytics wrong, in the sense that it delegitimises voterdecision-making? Answer: absolutely not. Here’s why.

The Tools of the Tirade
First, ours is an electoral democracy where caste, religion, regional and linguistic identity, and urban-rural divide have always been key inputs for campaign strategy. So, the difference between mohalla speeches that target a small subset of voters and targeted messages created by data analytics is a matter of different tools, not morality.

What’s the difference between reaching out to Rajputs through Whats-App or a small jansabha? The former is, possibly, more efficient as a messaging tool.

Second, that modern data tools can help isolate voters or individuals for very specific messages matters much less than critics will have you believe. US critics of data analytics have given examples of how social media campaigns helped political parties or lobby groups tailor messages for voters in small areas, or decide which venue in a locality would be better for a campaign rally.

Examples have been cited where social media preferences can be analysedto predict a voter’s political leaning and ethnicity. Much hand-wringing has also happened over the fact that in social media, users can’t see views contrary to their own once the platform learns enough and starts providing tailored content. All this, apparently, is subverting voter choice.

That’s an extraordinary claim to make. It assumes that the voter in any modern democracy is a helpless wretch who can’t access any other source of information other than what he gets from tailored content in social media.

If you spend 50 minutes a day on a social media platform, you apparently are unable to remember that there are multiple information sources, many offering views different from your own, you can access. Or, if you look at campaign messages targeted at you while posting vacation photos, you apparently are robbed of basic powers of thought. This silly assumption is at the heart of the big dataelections scare.

And it’s worse than a silly assumption when you consider the most basic fact of elections: no party wins a poll solely, or mostly, on the basis of the technological efficiency of its messaging. So, our third and last argument is that big data by itself can never swing a verdict and, therefore, it can’t subvert voter choice.

Why did BJP win in 2014 general elections? Because in Narendra Modi voters saw a viable alternative to Congress’ apparent governance drift. But we in the mainstream media were also guilty of making heroes out of data managers. We were taken in by their novelty.

However, those data managers and tech and management grads working in war rooms were simply spreading a message. Data analytics didn’t create the Modi wave. Political circumstances did. The medium was not the message. The message was the message.

A Shah & a Modifier
BJP subsequently lost Delhi and Bihar and swept in UP. BJP’s data use proficiency didn’t dip when fighting Delhi and Bihar assembly elections. And the once much-talked about data manager who worked for BJP in 2014 and for JD(U) in Bihar was plying his trade for Congress in UP.

What does this mean? Minus Modi and Amit Shah, two formidable politicians who have transformed the party’s election-fighting ethos, BJP wouldn’t have won so many elections. Without a clever alliance between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav, two veteran and wily Bihar leaders, JD(U)-RJD wouldn’t have defeated BJP in the state.

So, big data can’t subvert elections. Because the role of neta is far, far more important than the role of data."

711,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:01 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,BJP Dalit leaders apprehensive of antagonising supporters,"New Delhi: Protests across seven states during Monday’s Bharat Bandh over a Supreme Court verdict that diluted provisions of the law meant to prevent atrocities committed on Dalits and Tribals has put the BJP in a fix. Its Scheduled Caste leaders are jittery about losing support of the communities after seeing the support the bandh has received. BJP chief Amit Shah postponed his scheduled visit to Karnataka to avoid any embarrassment during public interactions in the poll-bound state by protestors, according to BJP insiders.

The party brass is closely watching the developments following violent protests in several states, most of which are under BJP rule. The Centre and the ruling party tried to salvage the situation by emphasising in Parliament and outside that a review petition has been filed. It also fielded its Dalit faces to underline that BJP stood for rights of SCs and STs.

However, BJP’s Dalit leaders appeared fazed by the developments.

Though they put up a brave front and several of them defended the party formally, some were apprehensive about antagonising supporters. Until not long ago, BJP had the image of a ‘Brahmin-Bania’ party. Its success in the last two decades can be attributed to the social engineering the party undertook and the support thereafter it has received from most communities, including Backwards, Dalits and Tribals. This advantage could be under threat following the protests, its leaders from weaker sections fear. Sections in the BJP apprehend that some Dalit leaders may rebel if the protests continue.

BJP’s Bahraich MP Savitri Bai Phule, troubled by her party launching a movement on quotas, had alleged there were efforts to end reservations in government jobs and educational institutions for Dalits and Tribals. She said she plans to hold meetings in different states. On Sunday, she held a rally in Lucknow to voice her concern over SC issues.

“Our movement continues. I will soon tour different states, including Jharkhand, Bihar and MP, to highlight issues relating to Bahujan Samaj. On April 15, I would be in Bokaro (Jharkhand),” Phule told ET on phone. According to her, she will visit Patna on May 11. However, she claimed that she is not against anyone. “We are fighting for our rights. We want proper implementation of reservation.”

BJP seems to be in no mood to initiate any action against her in view of its ongoing efforts to expand the party’s base among SC voters."

713,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:16 AM IST",PTI,Politics,Dalit protests: BJP calls Rahul Gandhi a 'political vulture' who is out to seek 'advantage',"New Delhi: The BJP today underlined the government's measures for the development of Dalits and dubbed Rahul Gandhi a ""political vulture"" out to seek ""advantage"" after the Congress chief blamed the ruling party for the community's plight.

Amid protests by Dalit groups and the opposition accusing the Modi government of working against the community's interests, Union minister Thawarchand Gehlot and Arjun Ram Meghwal, both Dalits, sought to turn tables on the Congress over its treatment of B R Ambedkar, an icon of the Scheduled Castes.

Their attack on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi came following his remarks that it was in the DNA of the RSS and BJP to keep Dalits at the lowest level in the Indian society.

Meghwal accused Gandhi of attacking the DNA of Prime Minister Narendra Modi among others. He claimed that as Modi came from a backward caste, the Congress leader could not digest it.

""Speaking of DNA, it is imperative to remind the nation what Rahul Gandhi's DNA is about -- humiliated Babasaheb repeatedly. Ensured the defeat of Babasaheb, not once but twice. Did not give a Bharat Ratna to Babasaheb. Did not even give space for Babasaheb's portrait in Parliament,"" he said.

Social Welfare and Empowerment Minister Gehlot underlined the Modi government's commitment to the community's welfare.

The BJP leaders' remarks came on a day violent protests by Dalit groups against a Supreme Court verdict on a law on atrocities against the community led to at least four deaths.

While past government used backward castes as vote banks, this dispensation is empowering them, he said.

""It has been our government which further strengthened the protection for backward castes by passing The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015,"" he said.

Successive governments did not put their trust in the people of backward castes when it came to lending by banks but with initiatives such as 'Stand Up India' and 'Mudra' people of backward castes are empowered to become entrepreneurs,Gehlot said.

""Our government is not only committed to protecting the rights given to SCs/STs but is going one step ahead and holistically improving their lives,"" he said.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government was not a party to the Supreme Court decision on the SC/ST Act and ""respectfully"" did not agree with its reasoning behind the verdict.

Prasad also said the government has filed a very comprehensive review petition in the matter.

BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said, ""As soon as some friction happens, our political vultures immediately come out to extract political advantage. We expected nothing better from Sh Rahul Gandhi. All that he & his party has done & can do, is to exploit the Dalits for petty political gains.""

""BJP's commitment to SC/ST welfare is unwavering & time tested. In 2001, Vajpayee Government specially amended Article 16 (4A) to ensure proper benefits to SC/ST employees. In fact, it was the Third Front-Congress govt of 1997 that took away promotional benefits of SC/ST employees,"" Yadav said."

Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, and Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress floor leader in the Lok Sabha, alleged at a press conference the Modi government was not interested in the welfare of the weaker sections of society.

They said if the Attorney General or Additional Solicitor General, the Centre’s top legal representatives, had appeared to defend the Act, the Supreme Court would not have passed the March 20 order banning automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Act. “This law was weakened and diluted because the central government did not represent the case properly before the court,” Azad said. “The Central government is responsible for this loss in the country. If the government had taken steps after March 20 when we gave them a memorandum to file a review petition, there would have been no loss of life and property in the country.”

The Congress leaders alleged after the NDA regime took office, atrocities on Dalits and minorities have been increasing."

Government accreditation is important for journalists to get access to ministries and government events.

Senior officials in the ministry said the issue of fake news was being addressed on a priority because “there was an increasing number of instances of fake news being reported in print and electronic media.”

According to the new guidelines issued by the government on Monday evening, the Press Council of India and News Broadcasters' Association will determine if a journalist is responsible for writing or spreading a fake news reports. In the first instance of violation, the person’s accreditation would be suspended for six months and for a year in case of a second violation. In case of a third violation, the journalist may lose accreditation permanently.

Ministry officials said rules have also been drafted to address fake news reports written by journalists who are not accredited, details of which would be made public soon.

Officials also said a list of journalists found responsible for violation more than once would be sent to all media organisations.

Raj Chengappa of the Editor's Guild said the organisation was studying the I&B ministry directive and that a statement could be issued on Tuesday. The president of News Broadcasters Association, Rajat Sharma, did not comment. Fake news reports would be referred to the Press Council of India in case of print media and to the National Broadcasters Association in case of electronic media, the ministry's note said.

“The determination is expected to be completed within 15 days by the regulating agencies. Once the complaint is registered for determination of fake news, the correspondent/journalist whoever created and/or propagated the fake news will have the accreditation suspended till such time determination regarding the fake news is made by regulating agencies.

Speaking at a media event recently, I&B minister Smriti Irani had announced the possibility of introducing a regulatory framework for news on the internet, contending that present regulations on online content were “not clear” on news and broadcast content material."
716,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:29 AM IST",ET Bureau,Defence,"Ahead of SCO meet, Delhi may refrain from a blanket opposition to China's OBOR","Delhi may nuance its position on Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in June and currently confine its opposition to the BRI's flagship project China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) with the grouping that made India a member endorsing the mega venture at the 2017 Summit.

India will attend the SCO Summit (being held in Qingdao in China) for the first time as a member after its admission along with Pakistan at last year’s Summit that hailed the BRI.

Delhi, under such circumstances, in a tactical move may refrain from opposing BRI in a blanket fashion for the time being and limit its opposition to the CPEC that violates India's sovereignty, indicated persons familiar with the matter.

What could further contribute to India’s position on the mega project is the fact that China is the host for the SCO Summit and BRI is Xi’s pet project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the Summit.

“The member states welcomed the One Belt, One Road Initiative. Having highly praised the results of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation that took place in Beijing on 14-15 May of this year, they supported the implementation of these results by coordinating international, regional and national projects geared toward cooperation in the interest of sustainable development on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,” read the SCO Declaration after the summit in Astana in 2017.

Delhi, like Islamabad, was not a party to this declaration as they were admitted as members at the very summit. But they will play an active role in shaping the summit declaration this year.

India is eyeing an active role in SCO to expand its presence in Central Asia and Eurasia including Russia, seek greater connectivity and business with the resource-rich region besides firming up partnerships to fight international terror"

The Enforcement Directorate and the CBI are probing alleged irregularities in the decision of a finance ministry wing to approve the investment proposal. Subbarao, who the directorate wants to join the investigation, was the finance secretary before he became the RBI governor in September 2008.

The directorate had recently examined a few bureaucrats who were members of the now-disbanded Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) when it approved the proposal. The agencies are investigating Karti Chidambaram, the son of then finance minister P Chidambaram, for allegedly influencing the FIPB decision. He has denied any wrongdoing.

The CBI had examined Subbarao in the case last year. Top sources at the agencies said Subbarao’s testimony would be crucial for them in proceeding with investigations. Based on his testimony, they may list him as a witness, the sources said.

Former members of the FIPB had told the CBI that they were apparently “misled” in INX Media’s proposal, ET reported on March 14.

They told the agency that they did not have all the facts when they approved the proposal. The Enforcement Directorate recently quizzed some junior officers of the FIPB who were involved in preparing the INX Media proposal.

The CBI is considering impleading some former members of the FIPB also as witnesses in the case against Karti Chidambaram and others.

In its FIR filed last May, the CBI alleged that Karti Chidambaram used his influence with officials of the finance ministry to manage a coverup of illegal foreign investments made in INX Media."
720,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:44 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,BJP prefers weak alliance partners; It can't dictate terms to TDP: Chandrababu Naidu,"Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has accused the BJP of conspiring to incite regional agitations and unrest in the state, in an exclusive interview to CR Sukumar. Excerpts:

Is it true that BJP’s demand for 10 Lok Sabha and 50 assembly seats led to the breakup in ties?
There was no such demand from the BJP. I would have turned down such a demand. BJP has not gained strength in Andhra to seek more seats nor has my popularity dipped for TDP to settle for fewer seats. We had partnered BJP in 2014 only in Andhra’s interest. The relations strained as BJP prefers weak alliance partners, like YSR Congress, facing corruption trials that could be controlled. It cannot dictate terms with TDP, which is not willing to compromise on Andhra’s interest. BJP is doing injustice to Andhra for political gains and punishing the people by not honouring assurances made in the AP State Reorganisation Act, 2014, and promise for a special category status. BJP does not realise that by harming Andhra’s development, it is hampering India’s development too. BJP is provoking five crore people of Andhra by denying them opportunities and benefits

Why did BJP accuse you of unilaterally snapping ties?
BJP snapped the alliance in Telangana unilaterally within a year of alliance. Despite that, we continued our ties in Andhra. It was only after waiting for four years in the hope that it would fulfil promises under the state reorganisation act that we quit NDA.

What prompted you to say a conspiracy was being hatched in the state?
What kind of signal is Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving by closeting himself with tainted politicians and financial fraud accused of YSR Congress undergoing trial? How does he want the public to perceive the relief the accused get after meeting him? Giving access to the fraud accused when the government is fighting corruption sends wrong signals to the nation and investigating agencies. Entertaining those accused of financial fraud either through nexus or access will help them escape easily and manage investigating agencies such as the CBI and ED.

Do you fear vindictive action against you?
Those who resort to high-handedness will pay. The YS Rajasekhara Reddy government tried its best to malign me with cases. They couldn’t achieve anything. My life is an open book. Our family has been disclosing assets and income from businesses every year. I contributed immensely to the development of Hyderabad and now I am striving for development of the residual state. I have dedicated myself to development of the state and hardly get time to spend with my family. I managed to attract so many large investments only because of my credibility. Those deeply involved in fraud are resorting to mudslinging against me.

Why did you accuse the BJP of inciting unrest in the state?
After I began raising my voice to protect the interests of Andhra, the BJP started inciting regional movements in Rayalaseema. Being a regional party, we are more nationalistic and the BJP, being a national party, is resorting to regional agitations. I hear that it may resort to political gimmicks like awarding a few large projects to Andhra in response to the demands of local BJP, YSR Congress and Janasena, and give credit to those three parties to help them gain in 2019 polls.

Do you expect BJP to join hands with YSRCP and Janasena?
They have already colluded and are harming Andhra interests for political gains. YSRCP wouldn’t question the BJP or the PM for not fulfilling bifurcation promises but keep extending unconditional support to BJP. Its MPs are always seen in the PMO, which shows a clear nexus.

What is your agenda for the two-day Delhi tour?
The agenda is to bring to the notice of the country the injustice done to Andhra and to mount pressure on the Union government… to mobilise support of the national political parties. I will meet available floor leaders of various political parties in Parliament and seek solidarity for our fight for legitimate rights of Andhra. I will request them to raise the issue in Parliament. The Centre should respect cooperative federalism. The TDP had earlier championed the cause of rights of federal states, following which Sarkaria Commission was formed. Whenever there is a threat to cooperative federalism, the TDP will certainly raise its voice.

Do you see a threat to rights of states?
The BJP is questioning utilisation certificates the Andhra government submitted against funds released. This is suspecting and disrespecting a state government, which is bad for cooperative federalism.

Do you favour a federal front?
For the time being, my priorities are on protecting Andhra’s interest. The TDP has always believed that regional leadership is nearer to the people and it will continue to work to help strengthen regional parties in the backdrop of cooperative federalism.

Where do you stand in the debate that southern states are being punished on devolution of funds for progress?
Despite non-cooperation of the Centre, I have delivered on my promises to the people of Andhra on development and welfare, including loan redemption. I have attracted huge investments into Andhra over the past four years, including some marque investments such as Kia Motors, Hero Motors, Ashok Leyland and Foxconn. Thanks to relentless efforts and initiatives, in the past four years Andhra has achieved double-digit growth, the highest among Indian states. I have transformed the state’s rural and urban infrastructure, apart from significantly improving power and water supply.

Do you hope to return to power after the 2019 polls?
I have no doubt about it. I am sure my party will sweep the 2019 election and also win all the 25 Lok Sabha seats in AP because despite non-cooperation of the Centre, I have delivered on my promises on development and welfare, including loan redemption. I have attracted huge investments into Andhra, including marque investments such as Kia Motors, Hero Motors, Ashok Leyland and Foxconn. Andhra has achieved double-digit growth, the highest among Indian states. I have transformed the state’s rural and urban infrastructure, apart from significantly improving power and water supply. But my government could have done much better than we have achieved so far had Centre fulfilled promises.

How can you build the capital city with public donations that you have sought?
My call for contributions from public was only to arouse the spirit and not that I can fully build the capital city with such token public contributions. The call was to prepare the people of Andhra to participate in the state’s development. It was in response to a similar call I had given in 2014 that people volunteered to offer over 33,000 acres of land worth over `40,000 crore for the capital city construction. The people of Andhra have been cooperating with my government and contributing to the state’s growth by offering land for various projects."

He said people are yet to get convinced about making banks private unlike the civil aviation sector.

“Public sector banks have invested a lot into infrastructure and other social sectors, and we must reward them for that. We must also do a cost benefit analysis of whether what we have built using this money can offset the (non-performing assets) NPAs,” said Subramanian.

He added that only giving direction to banks after privatisation might not work. “But to say that we must give private banks a ‘direction’ won’t work. If they are private, they will work for private incentive.”

Subramanian lauded the state governments for showing cooperative federalism in implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).

“There are a lot of things about GST like tax compliance, fiscal benefits and so on that are good, but for me, it in a way proved that India as a federal political entity could work. It showed their ability to rise above narrow interests, which is great, and I think the GST model can be emulated across policies. I think, cooperative federalism is the technology for reform,” he said.

The chief economic advisor said he recommended for standardised rate of GST and having one tax rate for all categories is easier said than done.

“In that report I wrote on the structure of the GST, what I said was we have to have standardised rate... My own view is that yes we need more simplicity in India and we need to move towards uniformity.”"

728,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:53 AM IST",ET Bureau,Economy,Home truths: Signs are ominous for housing finance companies,"When loan repayment ratios started to trip at an alarming pace, Udaipur-based SRG Housing Finance —lender in the hinterlands of south Rajasthan and Gujarat—devised a new collection strategy. They sought help from the sarpanch (village headmen), asking them to goad defaulting borrowers to “at least make part payments.”

It did the trick, apparently, as the housing finance company (HFC) managed to recover significant sums. “Peer pressure really works in areas where we operate,” says Sunaina Nagar, general manager, finance, SRG, which has an outstanding loan book of Rs 125 crore and 1.2% gross non-performing assets (GNPA). “We’re very cautious these days. We try to gather as much information as we can before assigning a loan.”

A loan was never a problem in India; getting the money back is. Average GNPAs of are hovering at 1.2% levels — a sharp spike from a healthier 0.5–0.65% maintained till last year. By end of the September quarter, close to Rs 10,500 crore of disbursed by HFCs have turned doubtful, as per data from CARE Ratings. Are HFCs sitting on a powder keg? No one wants to hazard a guess just yet but the signs are ominous. Bigger players remain relatively insulated, thanks to their heft and borrowing cost management. Many have sufficient capital and strong sponsors (banks or corporate houses).

Smaller players are vulnerable and could be in dire straits if their non-performing assets () turn credit losses. They maintain a narrow capital base and have very little financial support. It’s no wonder several are forced to adopt unconventional means, petitioning the or naming defaulters at an open . A clean-up looks inevitable. There were just about 70 HFCs in mid-2016; a year later, this number had risen to 82. At present, there are 92 HFCs operating and 14 more waiting for approvals from National Housing Bank, their regulator.

“There are 40 small players in the market with average capital of Rs 10-12 crore,” says Gagan Banga, vice-chairman, IndiaBulls Housing Finance, one of India’s largest HFCs with loan assets in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore. “As a result of high funding (borrowing from banks) cost, they are forced to chase borrowers with poor credit profiles and lend at 12-12.5% interest rate. Some are in serious trouble because of reckless lending.”

The stress is seen more in the segment, especially low-ticket size borrowers. “HFCs have not been able to predict borrowers’ cash flows,” admits Ramadasu Bandaru, AGM, CARE Ratings. His colleague, associate director Mitul Budhbhatti, chips in, “Several HFCs have expanded to untested markets without even properly assessing property values. A few have also given loans at high loan-to-value (LTV), which leaves lenders with slim collateral cover.”


India’s housing loan portfolio as of September 30 stands at Rs 15.1 lakh crore. Of this, HFCs, manage over Rs 6 lakh crore. As established HFCs grew, lending to retail borrowers for several years, they craved a share of the big boys’ (read banks) business pie. They created products to suit big-ticket borrowers’ needs — loans against property (LAP), corporate and developer loans, lease rent discounting buckets.

LAP eventually became the most effective weapon to bulk up assets. Most mid and large-sized HFCs lent cautiously at the beginning, but when more players jumped in, HFCs shifted from the restrictive tenets of prudent banking. The LAP book was 38% of total non-housing loans for the housing finance sector last fiscal. “LAP is a good product if valuation of collateral is right and loan is given on the basis of borrower’s cash flows. If collateral is not valued properly, LAP could be a very risky product,” says Keki Mistry, CEO, HDFC, India’s largest housing mortgage firm. “There have been instances of LAPs given on over-stated valuation certificates. Also, lenders are not in control of end-use of a LAP. No property is purchased with LAP funds in many cases.”

Several even lent money at high LTVs of up to 80%. So, for property worth Rs 1 crore (kept as collateral), some lenders loaned as much as Rs 80 lakh. Little did these lenders know that real estate prices would crash 15-30% in some micro-markets. “Delinquencies (in LAP buckets) have increased in north India…Lenders have taken excessive risk in these pockets,” says Ramadasu of CARE. “Delinquencies in non-housing loan books are higher than in housing loan books.”

An imminent danger to HFCs that have disbursed LAPs (at high LTVs) is a deeper correction in real estate prices. This is probably why some like IndiaBulls who were big on LAPs till a couple of years ago, have shrunk their books considerably. “Lenders who disburse LAPs after assessing repayment capacity of borrowers are safe. The ones that do asset-backed lending are in trouble,” says Banga of IndiaBulls.

Banga’s firm has seen a dip in GNPA levels from last fiscal, when it hovered at 0.85%. But the same cannot be said of others in the Big 5 club — LIC Housing Finance, DHFL, HDFC and PNB Housing Finance.

They have all seen an upswing in doubtful asset tabs. The Big 5 hold 90% of the industry lending book. Even HDFC logged a spurt in GNPA, from 0.72% last fiscal to 1.14% in H1 of FY18.

“The spike in our GNPA is because of just one account – Essar Steel. If not for that, our GNPA levels would be 0.82–0.84%,” says Mistry. “We lent money for their real estate… It was not given as a working capital loan. Our net NPA is negative as our provisions are far higher than statutorily required.”

Mistry raises a very pertinent point — the notorious devil in the detail — when he says HDFC did not lend money as working capital to the stressed Essar. Several midlevel and large HFCs did precisely that; lending to corporate groups and developers in stress. This was a good strategy, had the money come back on time. But in many cases, it did not. The only ‘soft option’ for the lender was to add the sum to the GNPA counter, create a provision and pray. “Our corporate loan book has shrunk over the past couple of years. Now, it’s just 6% of our total assets,” says Mistry.

“The shrinkage is partly because of our cautious approach and partly because no good corporate has approached us.”

A few HFCs have fallen prey to unscrupulous builders, who introduce ‘dummy borrowers’ (for a fat commission) as prospective customers. The builder gets bulk low interest funds (at retail rates) from the lender. The builder then tries to find a genuine buyer to sell down the apartment at matching or higher prices. Only if he succeeds, does he repay the HFC.



The top five smaller players, which have outstanding loans worth about Rs 15,500 crore, have seen GNPAs rising from 0.49% in 2014, to 1.24% in March 2017 and 2.15% in the first half of fiscal 2018.

“Our customers were badly affected by demonetisation… Many lost their livelihood at the time. So they could not pay us,” explains Sujan Sinha, CEO, Shriram Housing Finance, which manages assets worth Rs 1,700 crore. Sinha loans to the underserved segments of society, especially those in tier II-III cities. Close to 75% of his customers are self-employed, non-professionals such as drivers, maids, rickshaw pullers and other such work profiles.

“The current NPA stress is mainly on account of demonetisation; disruptions such as GST have also reduced the repayment capabilities of our borrowers,” Sinha adds. Shriram reported GNPA of 4.93% at end of the fiscal’s first half, up from 2.5% in the previous fiscal.

“We’ve become more cautious now, restricting our lending a bit,” Sinha confesses.

“But our borrowers had no mala fide intent when they defaulted on EMI payments. They just did not have enough to pay us after their daily needs. These people need some hand-holding and nursing to come out of their financial stress.”

Moderately capitalised mid-sized HFCs too are not in a position of strength. Their plan to bulk up assets by doling out generous LAP and builder loans has, prima facie, backfired. The top five mid-sized HFCs, with an aggregate loan book of Rs 71,997 crore, have reported a spike in GNPAs from 0.63% in March 2017 to 0.83% in the first half of this fiscal.

“GNPA in HFCs are at elevated levels but it is not a matter of grave concern as yet. We’ll get a clearer picture once year-end numbers are out,” says Sudhin Choksey, managing director, Gruh Finance, which runs a loan book in excess of `14,300 crore and logs GNPA of 0.67%, up from 0.31% last fiscal. “The smaller HFCs are facing an NPA problem… stemming from poor lending practices. We too lend to small-ticket borrowers, but we maintain a good balance between salaried and non-salaried.”



There is a shortage of about 19 million housing units in urban and 15 million in rural India. Affordable housing numbers are astounding, so much so that they present themselves as an opportunity for moneyed entities to throw their nets in. It’s the hot seller too, for most. As per a recent RBI report, the industry (including banks) disbursed amounting to Rs 42,990 crore in the ‘(up to) Rs 10 lakh borrower’ category last fiscal.

The central bank has also highlighted concerns on rising NPAs in lower ticket loan categories. Among all slabs, loans up to Rs 2 lakh has seen the highest NPA level, states an RBI report dated January 2018. NPA position in this bracket has surged from 6% in 2015-16 to 8.6% last fiscal. Anil Nair, deputy managing director, Aspire Home Finance, mentions a slew of external factors. “Demonetisation has impacted low income earners severely. RERA implementation has stalled several affordable housing projects. People have not got their homes till now and many have stopped paying EMIs.”

Aspire’s GNPA jumped from 0.58% at FY17-end to 2.84% in the first half of this fiscal. ET also sought views from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Aspire’s parent. CMD Motilal Oswal and MD Navin Agarwal felt that Aspire’s NPLs were higher but not alarming, as their loans are backed by solid assets. “Delay in setting up a dedicated collection team also impacted our asset quality,” they believe. Tamil Nadu and Delhi-NCR have higher delinquencies. NPA stress in Delhi-NCR is attributed to project delay while Tamil Nadu is reeling under political instability and the overhang of demonetisation, industry sources opine.

For newer HFCs desirous of making a mark in affordable housing, the focal group is clearly low-income rural earners with limited documents to prove eligibility (salary slips). Over 52% of borrowers from small HFCs are self-employed nonprofessionals. Mid- and large-sized HFCs have 33-37% of their borrowers from the non-salaried category.

“Lending to lower income groups can be a very profitable business, provided you have risk mitigants in place,” says Mini Nair, CEO, Essel Home Finance, a recent entrant. “You have to assess cash flows of prospective borrowers by sitting with them while they’re doing their business.” Many are first-time borrowers — a ‘minus-1 customer’ in credit scoring parlance. For them, HFCs simply follow hunch and hope.


“Borrowers from rural India only borrow what they need… It’s never wantbased borrowing,” says Anuj Mehra, MD, Mahindra Rural Housing Finance, which reported a GNPA of 13.26% at draw of September quarter.

“These borrowers would never default on a housing loan, unless they are pushed to extreme financial stress. And this stress maybe on account of a bad crop year or a drought or flood… They may delay payments, which may spike up NPAs in lender books; but it’s too early to deem these as credit losses,” says Mehra, who runs a loan book of Rs 6,500 crore."
729,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 08:01 AM IST",ET CONTRIBUTORS,Panache,"Office AC can make eyes dry, itchy and red: Here's what you need to do","By Dr Raghu

In an effort to provide a comfortable environment to employees, most of the workplaces these days have a centralised air-conditioning system. However, little do we know about the kind of harm air conditioners do to our health, especially eyes. While air conditioners provide relief and help us stay in cool temperatures, most of us are unaware that they create an artificial temperature change which in turn is unhealthy.

Falling sick quite often without any particular reason could be due to the long hours spent working in an air-conditioned environment. While the entire immune system is affected by the air conditioners, eyes, being a sensitive part of the body, are the most affected.

One of the major causes for dryness of the eyes, redness, itchiness, irritation, eye strain, recurring headaches and blurring of vision, etc is the air conditioner. Air conditioners reduce humidity and cause evaporative dry eye. As the temperature decreases, it reduces the Meibomian gland’s ability to secrete oils that keep the tears from evaporating too quickly. Further, AC ducts contain moulds, bacteria and virus which cause inflammation in the eye, thereby becoming a multifactorial source which cause harm to the eyes.

The dryness in the eyes reduces performance at workplace and thereby affects personal confidence. Although not life-threatening, people tend to neglect it which further affects the entire body system resulting in dry skin, allergy, generalised fatigue, osteoporosis and respiratory disorders.

Precautions to be taken to prevent the impact of AC on your eyes:
- Cover yourself properly
- Avoid sitting close to the AC
- Maintain room temperature. It is recommended to set the temperature above 23 degrees Celsius.
- Air conditioners reduce humidity in the air which can lead to dryness in the eyes. In order to prevent this, water can be kept in containers in the corners of the room; the water will evaporate and spread in the room and thereby increase the overall humidity.
- Prolonged usage of air conditioners can lead to formation of moulds and bacteria in the ducts which results in foul smell and infections. Hence, maintenance of the AC is very important.
- Maintain body hydration by consuming more fluids (for example: water, juices and milk). Avoid taking too much coffee or tea. The minimum recommended fluid intake is 2.5-3 litres per day.

TREATMENT
Lubricant drops are prescribed to reduce dryness. Anti-inflammatory medicines help too. If you find symptoms, visit an ophthalmologist. Your doctor will check the severity of dryness of the eyes and treat you accordingly.

730,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:54 AM IST",ET Bureau,Politics,"Lingayats are part of the Hindu fold, the move to separate them is unnatural: Organiser","“Lingayats are very much part of the Hindu fold, the move to separate them is unnatural, as historically and philosophically there is no distinction between the Veerashaiva-Lingayats and other Hindu practices,” says the editorial in Organiser, a journal inspired by the RSS, in response to the Siddaramaiah government’s move to give minority status to Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats.

As of now, the RSS has not taken a strong stand on the decision to give minority status to Lingayats, the Organiser’s edit has said it was important to address “why some Hindu groups wanted to separate themselves from the religion” and bag the minority tag. Calling the Karnataka decision ‘lopsided’, editor Prafulla Ketkar said the issue has raised the politically sensitive majority-minority question.”

Referring to the case of Jamia Millia University, it added “with a stroke of simple notification, 50% seats there are now reserved for the so-called minority community. At the same time, the institution gets exemption from the provisions of reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs in admission as well as appointments.”

“Such minority institution are exempted from implementation of the provision under the Right to Education Act. The trusts under the Hindu fold face restriction in managing temples and other social activities, unlike the minority institutions,” the edit said. The Union government last year had filed an affidavit in the Delhi high court opposing the religious minority status awarded to Jamia Millia Islamia, contrary to the position held by the previous Congress-led government.


Ketkar told ET: “Legal provisions in the Constitution based on caste or community should lead to social integration, not more divisions. When certain communities feel that staying in the so-called majority category is not in their favour because certain provisions are created for minority institutions, then these tendencies go up. This is why this new race for minoritism has gained momentum.” The Karnataka state cabinet decision to give minority status to Lingayats was seen as a masterstroke by Siddaramaiah to strengthen Congress’ vote base among the 85 lakh Lingayats, who were perceived to be a strong vote base for BJP.

The BJP and several sections of the Hindu community have maintained a cautious stance, accusing the Siddaramaiah government of dividing society to draw political mileage ahead of the assembly elections. Religious heads who supported the move have said that Lingayats are the worshippers of Lord Shiva who have distanced themselves from traditional Hinduism, including vedic practices.

In a meeting held last week in Bangalore, senior RSS leaders urged swayamsevaks to perform their national duty by uniting against “divisive forces,” according to sources.

An RSS leader from Karnataka said the move has given momentum to the Sangh cadre to actively campaign against the move, seen as contradictory to the Sangh’s philosophy of uniting all Hindus."

FPIs could either cover these or initiate fresh bullish bets if the slew of negative news like trade war fears, monetary tightening, etc, eases, or if there’s no fresh bad news, derivatives experts Hemant Nahata of IIFL and Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities said.

Based on outstanding positions (cumulative open interest), FPIs’ long-short ratio on index futures was 0.22 on March 28, a six-year low, ETIG Database shows. This reading is also way below the six-year average of 2.64.


“Chances of a bounce rise somewhat when you’re so short, at least in the short term,” Nahata says.

The shorts themselves indicate that FPIs are treading the markets cautiously – either hedging their cash market portfolios or simply punting. Interestingly, their long- short ratio on stock futures was at 1.36 on March 28.

This could mean they’re stock picking in the market or are simply selling some of their cash stocks and initiating long positions on the stocks’ futures so that they don’t miss out in case a of bounce back."
733,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 07:56 AM IST",Bloomberg,Stocks,Investors seeking a 2018 roadmap should look back to 1994,"By Joseph G. Carson

In testimony before Congress in February, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that some of the “headwinds” faced by the US economy in recent years have turned into “tailwinds.” I think he understated the issue: The boom in federal spending is more like a tailwind to a hurricane.

History offers few lessons on how to adjust monetary policy when there is an observed shift in factors that have retarded growth. The most recent, closest example is 1994, which turned out to be a terrible year for bonds, equities and the dollar. Back then, the headwinds of defense cutbacks, tax increases, balance-sheet strains and corporate restructurings began to wear off. However, there weren’t any noticeable tailwinds.

Nonetheless, the strong rebound in economic growth that materialized over the course of 1994 along with the threat of faster inflation with real interest rates around zero was enough to scare policy makers into a series of tightening moves that pushed the federal funds rate up from 3 per cent to 6 per cent over the course of 15 months. That was a much bigger increase than anyone anticipated.

Today, there is a growing consensus that the economy will get a big boost from recent tax cuts and increases in government spending. Powell’s testimony, where he also said that “fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for US exports is on a firmer trajectory,” signals a major change in the focus of monetary policy. Consequently, the Fed may be compelled to shift away from an accommodative stance to achieve its policy objectives. Instead, it may move toward a neutral or even a restrictive stance at some point.

Determining how important the shift from headwinds to tailwinds is to the economic and policy outlook is no easy task. Yet changes in government spending offer transparency not often visible in other segments of the economy. For example, President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion appropriation bill last week for fiscal year 2018. This provides the first installment of a two-year, $300 billion increase in defense and nondefense discretionary spending that was part of the budget resolution passed by Congress in February. Most of the money appropriated will feed directly into the government account of gross domestic product, and the rest indirectly into other parts.

Perspective on the potential scale of the federal spending increase can be seen in a recent article on the president’s budget published in the March Survey of Current Business by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It indicated that federal spending in the GDP accounts in calendar-year 2018 would increase by $100 billion to $1.364 trillion, and by $40 billion in calendar 2019. The actual spending gains will be much larger because BEA’s analysis is based on Trump’s budget proposal. Congress, however, increased the administration’s defense request by more than $50 billion and the non-military spending part by more than $100 billion for the twoyear period.

All told, the projected increases in federal defense and non-defense spending for 2018 and 2019 will prove to be extremely large, averaging in nominal terms at least 6 per cent to 8 per cent per year, which would represent the largest increases since the early 1980s. And that would come on the heels of a six-year period in which nominal federal spending increased on average a mere 1 per cent.

At some point, Fed policy makers will be forced to abandon their gradualism approach to policy and lift official rates faster and to higher levels than are seen in the “dot plot,” pushing real rates close to the 2 per cent area in the process. The focus of the financial markets at this moment is on the tariff announcements and the potential threat that a global trade war would have on the growth cycle. Yet the bigger threat to asset valuations will come from the tailwind pressures on official and market interest rates."

736,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 02:26 PM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,Bears maul ICICI and Axis Bank stocks,"Mumbai: Shares of India’s second-largest private sector lender ICICI Bank NSE -0.33 % slumped 5.9 per cent, the most in two-and-a-half years, amid a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into allegations of a quid pro quo for loans to the Dhoot family-promoted Videocon Group that benefited a firm promoted by the husband of the lender’s CEO Chanda Kochhar.

Axis Bank, the third-largest private sector lender, fell 2.2 per cent to Rs 498.20, after ET reported that RBI had asked the bank’s board to reconsider the fourth 3-year term it gave to CEO Shikha Sharma.

CBI is examining accusations that Venugopal Dhoot provided crores of rupees to a firm promoted by Deepak Kochhar six months after Videocon got Rs 3,250 crore in loans from ICICI Bank in 2012. The board, which met on Monday, is said to have discussed matters related to bankruptcy cases at National Company Law Tribunal. The board said last week it had full faith in Kochhar.

The stock has declined more than 20 per cent in the past two months but the uncertainty over the outcome of the probe will remain a drag on the lender’s shares, market experts said. “What would weigh down the stock on Monday would be investors surprised by the lack of disclosure by ICICI Bank of this particular inquiry,” said brokerage Bernstein in a client note released Monday. “ICICI board issued a statement referring to routine queries and responses to the regulator. This is a material event and ICICI Bank board would be better placed reporting the matter in ‘spirit’ and not as routine regulator queries in normal course.”

ICICI Bank’s shares ended at Rs 261.90 on the BSE on Monday, falling the most since August 24, 2015, and leading to the erosion of Rs 10,600 crore in market capitalisation. With the addition of the decline in Axis’ stock, the figure rose to ?13,500 crore in market cap.

“The direction this probe will take is yet to be seen but with this sword hanging over the top management of ICICI, it would be difficult for shares to move up. It may remain in a band as it has already corrected,” said Ambareesh Baliga, independent market expert.




“If the probe finds any corporate governance issue, then it can have a steep fall, since these private sector banks got a premium for corporate governance,” said Baliga.

Both ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have underperformed the banking index over the past year as well as the last three. In the past year, ICICI Bank has risen 0.5 per cent and Axis Bank has fallen 0.1 per cent compared with a 13.1 per cent rise in the Bank Nifty index. Some experts said they didn’t see the ICICI stock going much lower.

“A large part of the fall (in ICICI Bank) is over,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president, market and corporate affairs, at IIFL. “However, shares of corporate banks like ICICI will continue to be under pressure due to the change in NPA (non-performing asset) recognition norms by RBI. The fourth-quarter results of these banks are expected to be weak.”

ICICI Bank is heavily owned by domestic financial institutions and foreign portfolio investors alike. Experts said that while news flow around ICICI and Axis Bank is negative, it will not dent the image of private banks as a whole, which have enjoyed a premium over public sector lenders.

“If a compromised leadership is removed then it will be good for ICICI Bank and going forward, the lending will be better,” said a top official of a large fund house, which owns shares of both ICICI and Axis. Other lenders may benefit from the troubles faced by the two lenders. “Axis and ICICI Bank shares are over-owned by institutions and these funds may look to shift funds to other private banks. For retail investors, this is a good bargain as ICICI Bank is trading at one time book value,” said Bhasin.

However, investors looking for bargains should steer clear of the two , said Lalitabh Shrivastawa, research analyst at Sharekhan by .

“Corporate concerns emerging on the two private banks — Axis Bank and ICICI Bank — dampened investor confidence in an already weak banking and financial services segment,” he said. “The probe into ICICI Bank for possible irregularities on loan disbursement can have wider implications for the bank. Reports of RBI seeking changes in senior management in Axis Bank has also impacted sentiment. The developments may translate into near-term negative overhang on the stock and related indices.”"

“I have come here ahead of the official announcement of my candidature as I won’t have time to come later. You must consider yourselves Siddaramaiah and work for my victory,” said the CM, admitting that he was visiting the constituency after 12 years.

Announcing himself as the Congress candidate from the constituency, the star campaigner responsible for the party’s performance in all 224 constituencies told an uproarious crowd, “I have come back to you all. My party will form government again and I will continue to be the CM, if you people bless me.”

Pointing to the crowd, most of who were crunching on the apples from the garland now,

Siddaramaiah told ET: “They are all Vokkaligas. But they have come for me.”

His campaign managers, however, said that they were not counting on the 71,000-odd Vokkaliga votes but on consolidation of an estimated 45,000 Dalits, 50,000 Kurubas and 14,000 minorities in favour of the CM.

Chamundeshwari is an acknowledged stronghold of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (S). Since 2006, the Vokkaliga community that appears to revere the former PM and his son, HD Kumaraswamy, has been upset with former JDS state president Siddaramaiah for going against them. Siddaramaiah belongs to the Kuruba (shepherd) caste which is considered lower in the social hierarchy.

At Gungral Chatra, the village of Siddaramaiah’s opponent and sitting MLA, GT Deve Gowda of the JDS, villager Maade Gowda told ET: “Who will vote for Siddaramaiah? We want Kumaraswamy as CM. He is the only one to have done anything good for the state.”

Siddaramaiah has, however, ignored the advice of his close advisers and picked up the gauntlet to fight the May 12 assembly polls from Chamundeshwari. “The JD(S) has challenged me. I want to end my active political career in this constituency, which I first represented as an independent. But I also want to show them I can win here without them,” he said. His opponent, GT Deve Gowda, who was Siddaramaiah’s campaign manager earlier, appeared equally confident. “I will defeat him without any problem,” he said.

Siddaramaiah has represented Chamundeshwari five times since 1983, as an independent and Janata Party, Janata Dal and Janata Dal (S) candidate respectively. He lost twice here, in 1989 and 1999. “Both times, it was because my party split,” he said.

He won a high-voltage by-election in 2006 after stepping down as deputy CM, by a mere 257 votes. It was the first and the only time he contested here as a Congress candidate. “It was the toughest election I have ever faced,” he told ET, between hailing party workers and old faces in the crowd. “There was no demonetisation (to control cash flow). Both the JDS and the BJP, who were jointly ruling the state, ganged up to defeat me. But the people of Chamundeshwari held my hand and I won.”

In 2008, Chamundeshwari’s boundaries changed. Siddaramaiah shifted to the new, neighbouring Varuna constituency, named after a canal he had funded as finance minister that supplies Cauvery water to this otherwise arid region. He won with huge margins in 2008 and 2013, even as Varuna is dominated by BJP’s chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa’s Lingayat community.

This time, Siddaramaiah’s son Yathindra is tipped to contest from Varuna. And the BJP may throw a tough challenge by giving the party ticket to Yeddyurappa’s second son Vijayendra, a political novice like Yathindra.

“Both these constituencies are safe seats,” Siddaramaiah said. “I know the voters, many of them by name. They will stand by me.”

However, several areas that voted for him in 2006, including his village of Siddaramanahundi, have gone to Varuna.

There are also one lakh urban voters in the constituency and of the five wards in Mysuru city, two are represented by the BJP.

Many voters belonging to the dominant castes also complained of the CM’s “visible bias” towards other backward castes and Dalits.

Gayathramma at Yaachegowdanahalli pointed to concrete roads in the Dalit part of the village and said, “Our roads and drains are not done, only theirs are. Let them vote for him, why should we?”

But the mutual animosity between the Lingayats and Vokkaligas could help him, as is evident in Dadadakallahalli village. Lingayats here, like Shankara, are unhappy with Yeddyurappa, not bothered about Kumaraswamy and praise Siddaramaiah. “Can you see how much work he has done for the state? And for poor people like us?” he asked.

Former Chamundeshwari MLA M Satyanarayana, who is working overtime to campaign for Siddaramaiah, said that women across communities would vote for the CM. Vijaya in Chatradahalli endorsed this, saying, “Siddaramaiah gave us food for five years for free (though the public distribution system under the Anna Bhagya scheme). How can we not vote for him?”

But there are other factors at play as well. Yashoda, in Gungral Chatra, said, “GT is from this village. Satyanarayana is from our neighbouring village. How can we choose between them? One vote will go to each of them from our house.”"

744,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 08:57 AM IST",,Banking/Finance,Bandhan Bank to grow retail only when its field force learns the trick of the trade,"Investing legends Jim Rogers or George Soros never believed conventional wisdom of diversifying risks. Quantum Fund, co-founded by Rogers, saw 4200% returns in a decade by going against the standard model of spreading chips across the gambling table. “The expression on Wall Street is, don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. Ha! You should put all your eggs in one basket. But be sure you’ve got the right basket and make sure you watch the basket very, very carefully,” he said in 2016.

Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, current poster boy of the financial market, has never heard of the duo, but his instincts led him to take a leaf out of their book. Even after transforming his microfinance firm into a universal bank, Ghosh remains true to the inclusive vision of India, with undiluted focus on a well-performing idea, lending to the poor.

Investors have backed his strategy generously. Bandhan Bank NSE -0.58 %’s Rs 4,473-crore public offer was subscribed 14.62 times, braving all odds in a market jittery about the US’ raised hackles. Bandhan listed at 33% premium over issue price of Rs 375 a share, making it the eighth most valuable Indian bank in terms of market capitalisation.

“Bandhan Bank is a fantastic value proposition with its high quality franchisees to lend to rural India. It has successfully done microfinance for a long time, created a culture to lend to the poor in a low cost model.

Now, armed with a banking licence, it is expanding the model in a big way,” says Vishal Kampani, MD, JM Financial Group. For Ghosh, who learnt the nuances of women empowerment in Dhaka-based BRAC, an international non-profit development firm, and later at Village Welfare Society in West Bengal, it’s perhaps natural to put his bets on microfinance, which essentially lends to women at the grassroots. About 91% of Bandhan’s loan assets are in microfinance.

CHANGING CONTOURS
Let’s take a look at what others are doing. Equitas Small Finance Bank has reduced its microfinance portfolio to 46% in a bid to de-risk. Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, which has 85% concentration, is working on to reduce microfinance share to half. On the other hand, the likes of HDFC Bank or ICICI Bank are growing stakes with bottom-of-the-pyramid customers in quest of higher margins but their micro loan book would be negligible in their bigger scheme of lending.

Small finance banks that transitioned from microfinance companies have shrunk their micro loan portfolio to Rs 27,506 crore at end of December 2017, from Rs 29,773 crore a year ago. Part of it owes to stress due to demonetisation; part because captains of this new model were busy de-risking from a possible peril of concentration. They may not forsake microlending completely but their divided focus will shrink the weightage of it.

“Under microfinance business, we had to maintain (a minimum) 85% of total assets as qualifying assets (loans disbursed by an MFI). As a bank, there is no such restriction. We would like to cater to the different needs of our customers,” says Ajay Kanwal, chief executive, Jana Small Finance Bank.

“We would like to be the one-stop point for our borrowers. Affordable housing, twowheeler loans are something which small borrowers needs. Why should we leave it for somebody else to do?” says Govind Singh, CEO, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank.

The single product-single focus model leaves a lender vulnerable to risks.

“Microfinance requires special skills. You can’t approach it from a banker’s perspective,” says Ghosh, who replicated Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus’ model in India.

THE MICROFINANCE DEBATE
Four decades after Yunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983, the basic premise of microfinance has been challenged. “The initial narrative—that it was going to unleash entrepreneurial spirit of the poor, lead to significant growth and poverty reduction— was never really all that realistic,” Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, research director, World Bank, had said in 2015.

MFIs in Latin America were in the eye of a storm after Mexico’s Compartamos disclosed in 2007 that it charges around 105% interest rate, including tax! Its IPO was backed by commercial — not social — investors, including Accion. Yunus sternly criticised this commercialisation of microfinance.

Back home, MFIs today are regulated by the Reserve Bank after suspicion over their coercive recovery practices led Andhra Pradesh to ban private microlending. Their lending rates were eventually capped at 25-27% a year. MFI captains justify such high numbers for their apparent high transaction cost of lending at the doorstep. Banks could not build such an elaborate ecosystem. “Microfinance merely smoothes the consumption gap in the system. Borrowing from banks and lending at over 20% cannot reduce poverty. MFIs remain effective in a restrictive (area) as they are better than unorganised money lenders,” says former RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty.

“If they want to scale up, they need to be a bank to remain efficient.” RBI pushed a bank-led microfinance model with offering Bandhan a universal banking licence in 2014. It also offered 10 small finance bank licences a year later, eight of which were microfinance firms. Bandhan offers micro loans at 18.4% a year rate.


BUILDING RETAIL EXPERTISE
Bandhan’s strength is its network of 2,633 doorstep service centres and about one crore microloan clients. Doorstep service centres are low overhead banking outlets. Bandhan enjoys a net interest margin of 10%, the highest among Indian banks.

“It has been established that it’s safer to lend to smaller people than lending to big companies,” Chakrabarty says. Kampani says it would be easier for Bandhan to emulate what other private banks are doing now in retail over the next five years. But it not may not be possible for others to do what Bandhan does.

Ghosh, the man of the moment, has other ideas. “Banks are yet to develop the expertise of non-bank lenders in managing retail loan business. There is serious skill deficiency. We at Bandhan have built the top management team for retail. But we will not push this vertical in a hurry and wait till the time our own set of people learns the skills to handle retail portfolio.”

Till this time, Bandhan will look to exploit the opportunities available on the ground."
745,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 09:00 AM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,Suzuki-Toyota deal to help Maruti step up premium play,"ET Intelligence Group: The cross-branding deal between Suzuki Motor, Maruti’s parent company, and Toyota Motor for select models could help India’s biggest carmaker increase its presence in the premium segment as the Indian market matures and Maruti gets access to Toyota’s R&D to develop electric and hybrid powertrain in the long-term.

The access to green technologies may allay investor fears about the sustainability of Maruti’s dominance due to advent of electric vehicle, which entails high capital expenditure to develop new powertrain. However, in the medium term, it appears the deal will be more favourable to Toyota Motor India’s operations.

Under the cross-branding arrangement, Suzuki will supply Toyota two of its best-selling vehicles — Baleno and Brezza — for Indian market. Toyota will supply its executive sedan Corolla in return. The portfolio of Maruti and Toyota has been complementary, with more than 95 per cent of Maruti’s volume coming from vehicles with less than Rs 10 lakh price point, while 75 per cent of Toyota’s volume comes from above Rs 10 lakh vehicles.

The arrangement enables Maruti to gain marketing insight from selling a sedan like Corolla with investment in product development and capital expenditure. With more localisation of Corolla, Maruti could potentially lower the price of the vehicle and gain incremental volumes in high-margin executive sedan segment with sales volume of 1,000 units a month.

The cross-badging arrangement appears to favour Toyota as it will be able to sell Maruti’s best sellers like Baleno and Brezza through its network. Baleno and Brezza sell more than 30,000 units per month. Maruti sold more than 280,000 units of these two cars in the eleven months of FY18 and they have a waiting period of 5-6 weeks. Baleno and Brezza together account for 11 per cent of total passenger vehicle volume in India. Toyota’s has been less than 5 per cent with higher-priced vehicles, such as Innova and Fortuner, contributing the bulk of its volumes.

Given that Maruti has one of the best cost structures, thanks to its scale and high quantum of localisation, its for Toyota will be more competitively priced against what Toyota would have managed on its own. Besides, access to high volume vehicles will increase dealer viability of Toyota, helping boost revenue and level of interest in the Indian market.

However, success of the entire arrangement will be decided by the consumer as it is difficult to understand why a consumer would buy a Baleno or Brezza from Toyota dealership with a service network that is a fraction of that of Maruti.

Besides, Maruti will have a manufacturing margin for its cars, hence the prices though Toyota could be slightly more expensive than when bought from a Maruti dealer.

The recent Maruti-Toyota and Mahindra-Ford deals show that there could be more such tie-ups in the offing among major MNC carmakers with their local partners as the Indian market has proved to be frustratingly unprofitable for most foreign carmakers. Given that, a mutually beneficial tie-up with an Indian partner is the only logical step to remain competitive in the fourthlargest passenger vehicle market globally."
746,"Last Updated: Jun 20, 2019, 02:46 PM IST",ET Bureau,Startups,India Quotient’s new fund marks first close at $30 million,"BENGALURU: Early-stage venture capital investor India Quotient, early backer of companies like online lending platform Lendingkart and vernacular messaging platform Share-Chat, has made a first close at over $30 million for its new fund targeting $50-60 million. The venture firm has roped in Gulf-based billionaire of Indian origin Dr BR Shetty as a major backer with a $10 million commitment, with remaining capital coming from other HNIs and institutions like Government of India’s fund of funds managed by SIDBI.

India Quotient has till now raised $23 million across two funds, backing a total of 40 companies which are expected to hit a combined valuation of $1 billion, according to a statement. Overall the portfolio companies have raised $200 million in capital.

The new fund is a significant step up for India Quotient in terms of the corpus. It’s first fund of $5 million was closed in 2012 while the second fund, which raised $18 million, closed in 2015. The firm does not plan to change the strategy of backing seed stage companies, but the corpus gives it an ability to put more capital in each of them.
“A lot of our companies go out and raise money very soon, but we want to do less of that. We will put the first $1 million in the company ourselves and fund it for two years as most early-stage companies right now are getting funded for only 12 months,” said Anand Lunia, founding partner at India Quotient. According to Lunia, what differentiates the firm is its small team primarily comprising four partners, which is an exception given the size of the fund. Other partners at the firm include Madhukar Sinha, a former executive at Aavishkaar who has been with India Quotient since its early days, besides Prerna Bhutani and Gagan Goyal, both former entrepreneurs.

Some of India Quotient’s bets in areas like social, which include Sharechat and video sharing application , and in financial technology like Lendingkart and Loantap have already attracted follow-on rounds of funding. Other notable companies in its portfolio include cosmetics brand Sugar, job portal and fashion portal .

India Quotient will continue to focus on areas like financial technology, social and digital media, consumer brands and deep technology segments such as internet of things.
The fund expects to reach a final close in the next six months. Existing investors who have backed the fund include cofounder , Singapore-based family office and venture debt firm Anicut Capital founder Ashvin Chadha. “The massive challenges that India and developing world face in healthcare, finance, education can only be met by innovation. I believe the future in these sectors will be defined by entrepreneurs who use technology to offer solutions to the masses,” said Shetty, founder of UAE Exchange and London-FTSE-listed NMC Hospitals, on his investment in India Quotient."

Wall Street Plunges
Wall Street shares plunged on Monday as investors fled technology stocks amid resurgent trade war worries. Key indexes traded below their 200-day moving averages and the S&P 500 closed below that pivotal technical level for the first time since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. The selling was sparked by escalating trade war feas as China slapped tariffs on a host of U.S. goods as Trump prepares to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion on Chinese imports, and by Trump’s renewed criticism of Amazon.com Inc. The second quarter began with a broad selloff concentrated in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors led by Amazon.com, Tesla and among others. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 458.92 points, or 1.9 percent, to end at 23,644.19.


The has allowed banks to spread their bond trading losses, a change that is likely to boost profitability of lenders as well as spur a rally in stock and bond , reports Reuters. Under the change, lenders can spread bond-trading losses incurred in the December 2017 and March 2018 quarters equally over four quarters. This will come as a major reprieve to the public sector banks, which have been hard hit by trading losses from a spike in bond yields over recent months. The PSU banks, struggling under NPA burden, have been further hit by losses on their huge bond holdings due to a sustained spike in bond yields since July.


Vedanta Resources and JSW jumped into the fray to buy bankrupt Essar Steel, with the Russian bank VTB roping in the Sajjan Jindal-led steel firm to increase its chances of securing the prized asset in a day of dramatic developments on Monday. The Anil Agarwal-controlled Vedanta made a surprise entry into the race for Essar and will now jostle for capturing control of the firm with ArcelorMittal and the Numetal-JSW consortium. VTB is the largest shareholder in Numetal.


India’s automobile industry had its best fiscal year with data from manufacturers showing all-time high sales across segments. Analysts expect the momentum to continue in the new financial year, as economic activity is improving as well. Cumulative domestic vehicle sales growth in the past year was 13-15%, according to estimates based on data shared by industry players, hitting the double-digit mark for the first time since fiscal 2012. The two-wheeler, three-wheeler and commercial vehicle segments have each posted record double-digit growth, despite uncertainty over the implementation of GST and transition to new emission standards.


Recruitment activity is set to see an upsurge in India on the back of robust economic growth, says recruitment firm Michael Page’s India Salary Benchmark 2018 report, shared exclusively with ET. The main factors behind the projected increase in hiring include the government’s Make in India initiative that has sharpened focus on public infrastructure projects, more overseas companies recruiting to build their teams in India, enhanced activity in the renewable energy sector and increasing role of technology. Top recruiters are likely to include ecommerce and Internet, energy professional services and chemicals companies.


The Finance Ministry is confident of meeting the 3.5 per cent target for 2017-18 with revenue collections from direct and indirect taxes being broadly on target and ""natural savings"" by ministries. Finance Secretary said the government collected Rs 9.95 lakh crore from direct taxes, crossing the Estimate of Rs 9.80 lakh crore. However, the collections fell short of revised estimates of Rs 10.05 lakh crore. With regard to revenues from the Goods and Services Tax, the collection is 98 per cent of the Rs 4.44 lakh crore target set in revised budget estimates.

Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 60.50 points, or 0.59 per cent, lower at 10,204, indicating a negative start for the Nifty50 on Dalal Street.

Nifty50 needs to hold 10,200-mark for further upside
Were the index to hold 10,200-mark a short-term rally towards with initial targets of 10,280-10,350 range could be in the offing, said experts. ""Last eight days of price action chalked out a small but clear inverted Head and Shoulder formation on the lower time frame charts, which is suggesting a possibility of 250-point rally for Nifty50 in near term, provided the index sustains above 10200 mark,"" said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.


Asian stocks extended a global selloff and the yen rose on Tuesday as investors fled for safety as an escalating trade spat between the United States and China and a renewed slump in tech shares such as Amazon.com sapped investor confidence, Reuters reported. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.28 percent pressured by the tech sector. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 1.1 per cent while South Korea’s KOSPI skidded about 1 per cent with Samsung Electronics down more than 1 per cent.

Derivatives analysts expect a short-term bounce in benchmark indices given that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are heavily short on Nifty and Bank Nifty futures. FPIs could either cover these or initiate fresh bullish bets if the slew of negative news like trade war fears, monetary tightening, etc, eases, or if there’s no fresh bad news, derivatives experts Hemant Nahata of IIFL and Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities said.

A roadmap is being made for this and it is likely to be implemented by the end of 2019, top defence ministry sources said. A high-level meeting of the army was held last month to prepare the time table.

Closure of the four depots — the at Shakurbasti and the Central Vehicle Depot in Delhi, the Ordnance Depot at Cheoki in Allahabad and the Vehicle Depot at Panagarh in West Bengal — was among a series of reforms for the armed forces recommended by retired Lt Gen DB Shekatkar committee to enhance combat capability and rebalance defence expenditure.

Based on the recommendations, the private sector is being involved to run eight army base workshops, which do repairs and supply spare parts for the army’s main equipment. The army plans to hire a consultant to prepare a detailed project report on a government-owned contractor-operated model for the workshops.

The College of Defence Management at Secunderabad is also conducting a study on implementing the model. Currently, the Army’s five Central Ordnance Depots supply general stores, while the vehicle depots handle vehicles.

From these depots, the items are sent to the regional ordnance depots to supply to the different army commands. Then, they are transported to the division ordnance depots for supplying to the units.

The plan is to reduce the complexity of this chain that will improve operational preparedness at a time when China is becoming more belligerent along the Line of Actual Control and Pakistan continues to sponsor cross border terror actions.

“The army doesn’t require the four ordnance depots and is preparing to close them down. This means that a supply chain is removed and the items will be given faster to the formations. For instance, vehicles from the manufacturers will be directly sent to the units. This will also help in cost saving,” said a source.

Under the current plan, soldiers posted at the depots will be deployed at logistical elements located along the borders, helping the army improve the optimisation of its manpower. Civilians working at the depots will be posted elsewhere.

However, the civilian unions are unhappy with the move and have approached defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, sources said. A committee at the Ministry of Defence is looking into their demands."

More often than less, this has led to them prioritising their families’ health over their own.

Traditionally, diabetes has not been spoken in the context of women. But secondary studies have shown that there has been a rise in incidence of diabetes among women.


According to USV’s ‘Take the Power’ diabetes awareness survey, there’s a paradox prevailing in India — awareness about diabetes among women has been high, but the behaviour to prevent it has not shown a significant change:




""In reality, the step from awareness to positive action is very small; it is a matter of taking small steps, and establishing daily rituals and good practices that can minimise the effects of the condition (diabetes) and even reduce the chances of suffering from it altogether. One of the biggest of these steps could be for Indian women to start considering their own health and well-being on a par with that of their family... A conscientious decision by them to better manage their lifestyle with balanced food and exercise can be the key in controlling diabetes,"" says Dr Manoj Chadha, President, Endocrine Society of India and Consultant Endocrinologist at PD Hinduja National Hospital, Mumbai."

In an interview, Ramesh Iyer, managing director, told Shilpy Sinha that rural segment is growing faster than the urban segment and he is looking to expand to another 100,000 villages in the next one year.

Edited excerpts:

Mahindra Finance has NPAs in double digits. Do you see this falling to 4% as earlier?

Our NPAs have come down to 10% from 13%. It is a big change when you look at the gross number. It has happened in 1-2 quarters. If it is equalised for 120-day basis, we will be around 9%. We have maintained our coverage ratio at 55-60%. So, our net NPA is technically sub-4%. In our kind of customer segment, when somebody becomes 3 overdue, there is no way he can pay and come out. But when things improve, he may start paying. The other data point is out of the NPAs, how many customers are still servicing their loans. In the next 3-4 quarters, if markets remain like this and the government continues its focus on rural areas, we’ll come back to 6-7% of gross NPAs.



Around 50-52% of customers are paying EMIs. On a 90-day basis, we don’t think this business can be below 6-7% of NPAs. We cannot expect NPAs to go below that. When we were at 180 days, our NPAs were 3-4%. We will be extremely comfortable with 6% gross NPAs on a 90-day basis. Our credit losses will not be more than 2%. One credit installment not paid 1-2 quarters, may be not shown as NPA. We write off once we make 100% provisions. RBI allows us four years to write off. We do it in two. Every month, we repossess 3,000 vehicles. At any time, we will have stock of 8,000-10,000 vehicles across the country. These numbers have gone up.



We have seen big improvement in and Madhya Pradesh. We have not seen a big correction in Karnataka. Tamil Nadu may not show further improvement because the monsoon was not great. Demand is picking up across the country. Maharashtra is a good growth story for us. We see growth picking up in UP, and Andhra Pradesh. We are seeing flat growth in and Gujarat, while Karnataka and Kerala are not registering growth. North East is growing.



We have decent market share and don’t see growing it further. We will get growth through volume, which we believe will be in the range of 10-12%. There are non-Maruti segments – Hyundai and Nissan are going deeper into rural markets. Our market share is 5-7% and we see that growing to 12%. Pre-owned vehicles, growing slowly post as there no rate clarification, is growing more aggressively for us. It was 7% of the book and now may go up to 12% of the book.



We are very small in commercial vehicle and construction equipment segment. We are present in this segment to lend to customers with less than 5 or 10 vehicles. We are not in fleet-operator financing or for large contractors. That business is showing a growth of 100% for us but the book is also small. Our base is very small so our growth rate will be very high. Last year we did an average ₹250 crore disbursement every month that has almost doubled to ₹480 crore. For us to grow at 18-20% two more things have to happen and the price has to increase. For one, same volume discounts have to vanish. Commercial vehicle discounts have come down from ₹2.5 lakh to ₹1-1.5 lakh.



Loan waiver brings in more bargaining approach to loans. Somebody asks us not to charge penal interest. Farm-loan waiver is for sub-marginal farmers. They are not asset owners. In our case, customers bring in 25% margin money.



I am not convinced of the story that every year you should grow better than the previous year. In the past 23 years, our CAGR is 25%. So, one year if we are not growing doesn’t bother me. I would not shift to urban just because rural is slow. We took a bold decision to bring in a product vertical. One of the biggest challenges we saw in this circle was that we were very branch driven. Branch managers had the capacity to lend and recover multiple products. He had capability to handle a certain number of people and a certain number of customers. Suddenly, we found that it was becoming a challenge and a multiproduct structure was creating further fuss. In difficult times, you need to look at products differently. We changed it into an end-to-end product-based vertical. One team lends money and another recovers.



Rural is growing faster than urban in terms of the growth rate. I am just representing through vehicles like Bolero and Alto. Rural has restarted and is going to be the growth story, my answer is yes. We are talking about a history of 23 years. We have seen all cycles. There is enough scope to grow in rural. We are present in 330,000 villages. I have personally taken the target to add another 100,000 villages. We are 5 million customers and we believe these customers are used as an extended sales arm. Can they give us 5 million enquiries? If they do, I am good for next five years."

The first Sunday of April is when the festivities begin at the Augusta National Golf Club. Standing on the 18th green, just behind the iconic clubhouse, Conrad Chisman mustered the nerve to nail a 30-footer, right to left. With two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson watching, the kid kept his wits together to sink the next one from 15 feet to win the putting contest for 12-13 year old kids in the Drive, Chip & Putt Championship.

Chisman was one of 80 young children, between 7 & 15, partaking in a spring feast that sows the seed of dreams, hoping for a harvest of love. The DCP epitomizes golf’s intensifying efforts to reconnect with families and children even as the game faces an increasingly threatening midlife crisis.

A YouGov survey released in January this year suggested that golf was suffering increasing apathy. A sample of 1,616 adults rated the game, alongside cricket and American football as the most tedious to watch. Nearly half of the world’s 40,000 golf courses are in the United States.

But according to the National Golf Foundation, a premier source of golf intelligence, the number of active golfers in the US is around 23.8 million, down from a peak of 32 million earlier this millennium. Even more worrying has been a steady 30% decline among golf enthusiasts aged 18-34.

But conscious efforts by the Augusta National, USGA and PGA in America and the R&A in Europe might be doing just enough to tilt the needle back. In its 2017 report, NGF cited a 14% increase in beginning golfers from its numbers in 2015.

Bob Baldassari, director of youth development for the PGA of America is enthused by the joyous spirit that sur rounds the Drive, Chip & Putt Championships in Augusta. “The beautiful thing,” Baldasarri said, “is that it’s about every kid, every ability, everywhere. It’s bringing families together.

And it’s moving the needle for growing youth golf in America.” The reward for Chisman and several other children in attendance was the lingering scent of dreams in their lungs as they left the club feeling like champions.

“He made the last putt, how special is that?” asked Watson, moments after watching 8-year-old Taighan Chea make a brilliant 15-footer on the 18 green. “Twenty years, thirty years from now, rest of his life, he’s going to be able to tell everybody he made the putt, no matter if he plays professional golf or becomes president of the United States.”

Back in India, the Indian Golf Union is in a constant battle for resources as it attempts to strengthen the game in India. Shubhankar Sharma is a product of India’s fledgling youth system run by the IGU and sharpened by the PGTI Tour. As he makes his debut this week in the Masters, the 21-year-old could have a captivating influence on young children, especially if he can produce a memorable run in Augusta.

Ishwar Achanta, a council member of the IGU, believes that there is a pressing need for 3-hole and 9-hole courses across academic institutions in India. That wisdom is borne from a deep-rooted understanding of the paucity of resources for competition courses and a desire to introduce the game to young Indians.

As is the case with Test Cricket around the world, there is an increasing disconnect with weekend golf competition played over four rounds. Recent innovations such as golf sixes, played over six holes and the four-decade old World Long Drive Championship are finding echoes around the world.

As we have seen with Shubhankar, golf could also produce us new heroes. “First we need more Indians playing (the game). In majors, the conditions are different and the crowd is much more. Indians can win one in the next few years,” he said before leaving to play on the PGA TOUR.

Shubhankar can take us nearer that dream, if he can produce his A game this week."
762,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 01:23 PM IST",ET Bureau,Sports,A trip down memory lane with Sourav Ganguly- the captain who wanted to make a difference,"The moment you enter Sourav Ganguly’s rather ornate office in his house in Behala in south Kolkata, you are bound to notice Sourav Ganguly standing inside a glass cabinet. Well, it’s a smaller sized replica of the man in a bandhgala, next to a giant photo of an outstretched Ganguly in Kolkata Knight Riders gear. In fact, the large room, with Corinthian pillars in the centre decked with plastic flowers, is a shrine to arguably India’s finest cricket captain.

Before the real Ganguly walks in, muttering about how much cricket administration takes up his time these days, I notice a packet on his large table addressed to ‘Sri Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, former chief minister of West Bengal’. Framed photos with Jagmohan Dalmiya, Amitabh Bachchan, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Pervez Musharraf, Allan Border, Ian Botham adorn the walls.

We start with his comeback to Test cricket in end-2006, after a very difficult phase that not only saw the public brawl between coach Greg Chappell and Ganguly hit the proverbial ceiling, but this was also a time when he was struggling off a 10-month period of poor form. “I had seriously started to doubt whether I would be ever recalled,” he says in Boria Majumdar’s forthcoming book, Eleven Gods and a Billion Indians.

“Yes, because you never know in , there’s so much talent. Once you miss out, somebody comes in, somebody plays well, you’re invariably left out,” he says, settling into his CEO swivel chair. “And at some stage I also felt that it was much more than just my cricket [that was going to decide my cricketing career]. And if there’s more than just cricket, then it’s not in your hands.”

Did his desire to prove people wrong fuel his determination? Or did that make the thought of staging a comeback even more crippling? “I just wanted to go and play the game and score runs,” he says a bit too nonchalantly not to hide a subtext. “I was 32 or 33 then, and I wanted to play. It was very close to my heart. I felt that I was good enough to play for India – which I did.” And perhaps the best cricket of his career.

This was really re-baptism by fire, considering he was given the India captaincy in 2000 at a time when Indian cricket was almost on life-support after the match-fixing debacle. What was it that drove him then to take on captaincy by the scruff of its neck?

“I wanted to make a difference. I’m that kind of person. When I do something, I get very committed to it and make sure that everything is in the proper place.” Right from the beginning? “From the beginning. Also with time and age, you grow a little older, you see things a bit differently.”

In March 2001, Ganguly led the squad that took on Steve Waugh’s Australia. He described the famous Eden Gardens victory after followingon as a ‘miracle’. “That win changed the team, it changed everything.

Because of the quality of the side we beat. Australia that time was the best team I’ve seen in the last 20 years, even till now. That Australian side,” he trails off as if he’s Field Marshal Montgomery talking about Field Marshal Rommel’s Afrika Korps.

But more than just a ‘miracle’, Ganguly showed his mettle. Like his decision to push VVS Laxman up the batting order. “I didn’t know when I pushed him up at No. 3 that I would get results. He was in good form. He had got 70-odd runs in the first innings, he was hitting the ball well. In life, and in sports, you have to take decisions before the result. And you have to believe that it works, and you hope that it works. And the VVS decision worked.”

Did he have heroes, role models as captains? “Not really. My captaincy happened very suddenly. So, at that stage of my career I was trying to get better as a player and cement my place in the side. So, I didn’t think so far ahead. But I had someone like Sachin in the team. I also played with a lot of captains like Nasser (Hussein) and Steve (Waugh). These were the two, I thought, right up in the list.”

Knuckling down on the table, Ganguly gets into a board meeting mode. “You also try to get the best out of the people you lead. Steve Waugh had a great bowling attack. So for him to lead a team was a lot easier than it was to me. When you have McGrath, Warne, Gillespie and Bret Lee, you can just stand at gully and just keep shifting the field. I had to get the best of my bowling attack.”

Here are some fun facts about these airports to keep you company:

Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi

1. New Delhi Airport’s new 101.9-metre high ATC tower is the tallest in India, towering over the Qutub Minar too. It gives a 360-degree view of the airport and will be operational from 2018.

2. The ATC tower is supported by 32 pillars, driven almost 24 meters underground. The foundations, reports say, are strong enough to carry over 1,500 African bush elephants.

3. Delhi Airport flew 63.5 million passengers last year, which is approximately equivalent to the entire population of France. It is the first Indian airport to handle more than 60 million passengers in a year.

4. One of the country’s busiest gateways to the world, Delhi operates five flights in every four minutes.

5. It is also Asia Pacific’s first carbon neutral airport and uses clean energy from its in-house solar power plant to support its Airfield Ground Lighting system.

6. The airport’s Terminal 3 (5,400,000 sq ft) is the largest building in India built post-Independence.

7. Delhi Airport is also among the top five airports followed on social media globally. It is number three on Facebook with 6,61,127 followers and number four on Twitter with 82,094 followers as of March 27, 2018.

Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai

1. Food outlets inside the airport accept orders from passengers and deliver hot meals to them at the boarding gates on selfbalancing scooters.


2. Three therapy dogs – Cocoa (1.4-year-old Shih-tzu), Muffin (1.2-year-old Labrador) and Angel (1.7-yearold Golden Retriever) visit Terminal 2 every weekend to help destress passengers who suffer from flight anxiety or are first-time fliers."

Fitness has been of paramount importance to the women’s team especially with a busy calendar year – starting with the Commonwealth Games this month followed by the Asian Champions Trophy in May, the World Cup in July and the Asian Games in Jakarta. With so many major tournaments, it is important the girls remain free of injury.

I took over the reins a few weeks before the 2017 Asia Cup in Japan. The morale in the dressing room was low after a series of losses earlier that year. I was later told that some were sceptical about how things would pan out under my coaching as they had heard of my imposing nature of being a task-master.

But the one thing I consciously did was not impose any new strategies ahead of the crucial Asia Cup, winning which would be enough to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. For me the priority was to reinstate self-belief. I would call for regular meetings and almost plague them with presentations that showcased examples to instil confidence.

From motivational and team-bonding videos to stories of war heroes like Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi was put out there for the girls to realise that if they put their mind to it they can be world beaters.

I also drew experiences from my own life, particularly the mistakes I made. And while we worked on changing their outlook of the game with scientific methods like the neuro-tracking and classes on sports psychology, we also worked on improving their fitness.

We knew that if the girls can see for themselves how strong and dangerous they can be on the field, it would automatically enhance their confidence and change their body language.

Wayne Lombard, the team’s scientific advisor, had already set up a systematic regime that was showing results.

After the success at the Asia Cup, all we did for the next two national camps – about 45 days – was focus on strength and conditioning. The sessions were strenuous. The daily routine was physically demanding – weight training, a lot of running and conditioning and tactical training on the pitch.

For over six hours a day, the girls were busy slogging it out in the gym or on the pitch. I give a lot of credit to them for staying strong and motivated through this period. The results of the fitness camps have been evident with the team’s YO-YO test scores going up remarkably. The team’s average of 17.5 last year has gone up to 18.5-19 with the highest score of 21. It is a work in progress but we have the capability to achieve better standards.

I am also happy that the team does not look to one player to score. If you analyse our matches of late, we have three or four different goal scorers compared with earlier when everyone turned to Rani (Rampal). No doubt Rani is the No 1 striker but with others contributing to the scoreline, she has taken on bigger responsibilities and has turned into a playmaker.

For me, it’s not the goal scorer who calls for praise but the one who assists and the team is aware of this.

Beating higher-ranked Asian teams has been a big plus. But to do well against European and Oceanic teams, we need to be extremely agile, fit and fast. At the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, these factors will come into play.

We begin our campaign against Wales. Though I believe in the cliché that no match is easy to win, consistently playing high-level matches over the last few months should give us an edge over teams like Wales and Malaysia who are in our group.

But we need to come up with significant overall performances against England and South Africa to ensure a place in the semi-final. We have worked out our plans for each of the teams and all I expect the girls to do is to focus on their strength, their game and the results will follow.

While passenger and goods trains run between the two countries, this is the first time that a container service will begin.

Container trains are usually used to ferry machine parts, chemicals, automobiles and consumer durables that involve a shorter transit time.

If successful, the service would drastically reduce the transportation time,"" said senior officials. The Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor), a PSU under the railway ministry will handle the logistics of the container service.

The impact is likely to be on teams which may have over-hired, one of the sources said.

Amazon confirmed the layoffs in India, saying it was a part of the company’s global process. “As a global organisation, we have recognised the need to organise our teams to keep us agile and help us use our resources optimally. This has impacted a small number of roles within the company and we are providing complete support to the impacted employees, including the option of relevant internal postings and outplacement services,” a company spokesperson said, adding that Amazon continues to hire for multiple roles and currently has 4,000 job openings in the country, including several from previous years. ET reported in February that Amazon’s move to lay off hundreds of employees at its Seattle headquarters and global operations were likely to have an impact on its India business.

“This is part of a global reorganisation as Amazon and (CEO Jeff) Bezos look to strategically deploy resources into high-growth and priority areas to further drive the consumer flywheel over the coming years,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at New York-based market research firm GBH Insights."

Facor has been under insolvency resolution process and the 270-day period for insolvency resolution of the company got over on April 2, 2018.

Facor received bids from Swiss-based metals trading group IMR, IMFA Ltd, one of the country’s largest integrated ferro alloys producer, (REC) and a couple of lesserknown players like Synergy Steel and . While Balasore Alloys had evinced interest in the company, it did not submit a bid. The original deadline for submitting bids was on February 7, which was extended three times till March 29. While the IMR and IMFA had submitted bids before the first deadline, the three other players entered the fray after the deadline was extended a third time.

IMFA, one of the resolution applicants for Facor, intervened in the matter on Monday seeking consideration of its bid which it felt was wrongly rejected.


IMFA s appeal against Facor ’s Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process is pending before National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which has reserved its order though no stay has been granted on the liquidation. The next hearing is due on April 11. KG Somani, the resolution professional for Facor is a Delhi based CA. FACOR, which is owned by the Saraf family, has a 45 MVA furnace with three mines and 100 MW power plant with its subsidiary Facor Power. It defaulted on loans worth `750 crore while the company’s liquidation value was about Rs 400 crore.

REC has over 90% exposure in Facor’s debt. Established in 1955, Facor operates captive chrome ore mines. However, output reduced with two mines having been shut down altogether. The company was referred to CIRP in June 2017 on account of default by Facor Power to the tune of Rs 750 crore. The group started out with a ferro manganese plant in Shreeramnagar, Andhra Pradesh, and diversified into various types of ferro alloys. Later, it established a large chrome ore mining complex at Bhadrak in , followed by the first charge chrome plant in 1981."

""We're concerned, with the financing structures for connectivity projects,"" Alex Wong, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs told reporters during a news conference here when asked how the Trump administration is going to really propose the alternative for the infrastructure support as against those by China.

""Because if they're not structured in a way in which the nations of the region can sustainably pay them back, over time, you will see that tends to compromise their sovereignty,"" Wong said.

""We're concerned with how projects are conceived of and implemented because we want these projects to be economically feasible. We want them to be connected with the economies of these nations in a smart way that increases their GDP, truly drives regional integration, and doesn't weigh them down,"" he said.

The American interest, he said, is in infrastructure and connectivity throughout the Indo-Pacific.

""We're less concerned with where the financing or from which country financing for infrastructure across the region comes from. We are more concerned with how that financing for infrastructure is structured, and how the particular infrastructure projects are conceived of and implemented,"" he said.

For decades, the US has been advocating for strong connectivity principles, facilitating good connectivity projects, preparing the investment frameworks and the investment environments in the region to drive private capital to these types of projects, he said.

""In the Indo-Pacific, the Asian Development Bank says that there's about a USD 1.7 trillion per year investment gap for infrastructure, what they truly need to encourage the type of GDP growth been seen for a number of years in the Indo-Pacific. But that gap won't be filled by only state-backed financing,"" he said.

""It can only be filled by getting private sector money off the sidelines,"" Wong said. Currently, there is USD 50 trillion in private sector capital and cash instruments that are uninvested around the world.

""If we can get that into the Indo-Pacific to invest in quality best-value infrastructure, that'll be to the benefit of many of the countries in the region, to our benefit, as the GDP of the region grows and our trade and our investment grow,"" he said.

But there is a problem right now in the Indo-Pacific, Wong said. In the developed world, for every one dollar in state financing that goes to infrastructure, one gets two dollars in private capital. But in the Indo-Pacific, for every one dollar in state financing, one only gets 30 cents of private capital into these projects.

""There's a gap there, and we need to help the nations of the region ensure that they can access that private capital, craft the projects in a way that does attract investment money, ensure that their regulatory environments and their bidding processes are attractive to private capital.

""Then if we can do that, we can fill that infrastructure gap, provide the alternatives that are needed by the nations of the region, so that infrastructure is done right and truly ensures economic growth,"" Wong said."

The Trump administration has sent two of its senior diplomats from the State Department -- Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Thornton -- to co-lead the American delegation for the trilateral dialogue.

The crucial dialogue between the three leading democratic powers of the Indo-Pacific region on Wednesday comes a fortnight ahead of the Trump-Abe summit at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida resort.

During the two-day summit on April 17 and 18, the two leaders will reaffirm the US-Japan alliance as a cornerstone of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, the White House said today.

While Wells has just returned from Pakistan, Thorton completed her trip to Malaysia before heading to New Delhi where she attended the US-ASEAN Dialogue to engage on regional security and economic issues.

On April 6, Wells will participate in the India-US Forum, hosted by the Ananta Centre and the Ministry of External Affairs. During her visit, she will also meet with senior Indian government officials to discuss regional and global issues and representatives from the private sector, the State Department said.

The India-Japan-US trilateral was launched in December 2011 when Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State. For the first several rounds the trilateral was held at the director or assistant secretary level.

It was elevated to ministerial level in 2015. The inaugural ministerial trilateral was held on September 29, 2015, in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly Session. It was hosted by the then US Secretary of State John Kerry. The External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida represented their respective countries.

An oil refinery in a region in India that’s more famous for its tea plantations is hoping to put its abundant greenery to new use.

A $200 million joint venture between Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. and Finnish technology firm Chempolis Oy will crush bamboo, the longest of the grass family, to produce 60 million liters of ethanol every year in the tea producing state of Assam. That’s enough to meet mandatory requirements for blending with gasoline in the entire northeastern region. The eight states that lie at the foot of the Himalayas together make up about two-thirds of India’s total bamboo production.

""Bamboo is in abundance in the northeastern states. It grows everywhere,"" said the Indian state-run refiner’s managing director SK Barua in New Delhi. ""It will be a game changer for us and for the country.""

Record growth in Indian oil consumption means Prime Minister Narendra Modi is turning to everything from sewage water to crop residues to blend with diesel and gasoline. Apart from keeping up with the country’s surging demand for fuel, Modi is also trying to fulfill his pledge to meet a 10 per cent reduction in the nation’s energy imports by 2022. As a result, the biofuels industry is set to explode into a $15 billion market by 2020 with government backing.

Bloomberg


Indian oil companies are investing in biofuel refineries to boost ethanol production from non-molasses sources such as agricultural residues and even petrochemicals. But usage of the contemporary fuel has been slow to catch on. Just 2.1 per cent of gasoline is being blended with ethanol, while very little biodiesel is mixed with diesel. The goal this year is 5 per cent blending for both.

""Bamboo will play a role in India’s energy security and promote green fuel use,"" Barua said. ""It will be the first experiment, but it’s not a complicated project."""

Edited excerpts:

Do you think the Reserve Bank of India allowing banks to spread their bond trading losses over four quarters, is more like an accounting move? If you have to extend your losses for four quarters, you may get some relief in this quarter but that does not compensate for the loss which banks would have had in the current quarter because of the uptick in bond yields?

The provisions are there in this quarter also and so it is a good relief. Since we had taken the full provisions in December, I can write back about 50% of that -- 25% in December and 25% in March quarter. It leaves me with about 50%. Our mark to market provisions were Rs 444 crore in December quarter. That means about Rs 222 crore of provision, I get back in this quarter. Again this quarter’s provisions are slightly less than last quarter’s.

 »
I will not be able to give you the number now but then there also, I have to make only 25% provision. We need to keep in mind that this is a heavy quarter for us by number of provisions that we have to make because of slippage of SDR, S4A accounts. So, the RBI provision gives us a good relief in this quarter.

Could you quantify for us what kind of provisioning are you accounting for in terms of the losses that you may have incurred and how do you hope to spread that out over the course of the three quarters or four quarters that the RBI has indicated?

I will not be able to give you this quarter’s numbers but last quarter’s numbers are published numbers. As I said, we had a mark to market provision of Rs 444 crore in December. Out of that, we will be able to write back 50% this quarter, that is about Rs 222 crore. In addition to that, this quarter’s mark to market (MTM) provision is only 25%. I have to make the provision. So, this quarter gives us good relief. Because of the resolutions which we are seeing in Q1, Q2 of next year, I think the pressure on the bank will be much less, whereas the pressure is very high in this quarter. It comes as a very good relief during this quarter.

Does it suffice to say that lower MTM provisioning is going to cushion your profits a bit when you report your numbers next?

Yes. Actually, we have a better cushion for making NPA provisions which are much higher this quarter.

Out of your total treasury book, how much is currently in the AFS (Available For Sale) category and how much is there in the HTM (Held to Maturity) category?

For us, HTM is a major portion but then about Rs 17,000 crore is held for the AFS category.

But broadly looking at the two important news developments which have happened. First last week Government of India announced their borrowing plan and now Reserve Bank of India has given a relief on how to treat mark to market losses. Can I safely say that for your treasury book, the worst is over because bond yields are not rising and you would be able to provide for collateral damage, if any?

It is very difficult to comment on that issue at this point of time because the yields actually have responded to the borrowing programme which is much lighter from the government side. As we go forward, we will watch this. We still have certain doubts on the way the yields will stabilise. We need to watch the monitory policy and other macro numbers before we take a call. It is very difficult to take a call at this point of time.

When Reserve Bank of India came out with their new NPA norms on 12th of Feb, everyone thought that for PSU banks this is a death knell. They would be forced to write off and a huge NPA was expected from telecom and power sectors. Are we in for some kind of shocker from PSU banks or is it not going to be that bad?

At this point of time, I would not like to share any numbers. Whatever is in public domain, I have already shared because these SDR, S4A, the withdrawal of forbearance and some of the standard accounts, which are not fitting into the norms are slipping. It will give a very fair estimate of the stress in the books.

This quarter will be slightly heavier but we are very sure that the timely government capitalisation will help us to sail NSE 0.27 % through this quarter. Next quarter onwards, the resolutions which are going to come through the NCLT and other means are going to bring back normalcy in the banking book. That is what I feel."

It’s a move reminiscent of Tesla’s last vehicle launch—the Model X—when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.

“Car biz is hell,” Musk said.

The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla’s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of the company’s forecasts.

The exchange, with a reporter at The Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla’s head of engineering, Doug Field. For the last year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn’t design cars that are “crazy hard to build,” but now that Tesla was back in the thick of production, “it’s better to divide and conquer.”

Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand—and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter, and achieved a final burst of production of as much as 2,200 cars a week.

Musk had vowed he would be making 2,500 cars a week by the end of the first quarter—a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half-million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove that it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company.

When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.

It’s not clear where Tesla’s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company’s battery Gigafactory. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla’s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed last month.

If Musk is instead camping out at carmaker’s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won’t, happen. Even if Tesla is able to reach its first-quarter production target, it’s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it.

According to Musk’s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn’t emerged from production hell just yet. See the final estimates from Bloomberg’s Model 3 Production Tracker."

The bank is also extending the option for consumers to check their credit scores and apply for a credit card while onboarding.

“Almost 30% of our customers opening accounts with us through the 811 product are showing eligibility for a credit card. We have already given out over 70,000 credit cards to 811 customers,” said Deepak Sharma, chief digital officer at Kotak Mahindra Bank. Sharma added that limitations like specific pin codes where the bank does not lend and people with next-to-no credit history are a few of the reasons it is yet to scale up the credit product digitally in an aggressive manner.

The bank hopes to take digital banking to remote corners of the country with 811 that is simple and useful as a mobile wallet but is also stacked with multiple features of a bank account. Sharma said that having already reached a 12-million customer base from eight million in the beginning of the year, the bank is close to the 16 million it targeted for the current financial year.

The bank also found that the number of times an individual customer logged into the banking application has jumped to 16 per month, from around 8 previously. “We are targeting to push it up to 30 logins per month in another one and a half year,” said Sharma.

The bank also launched ‘Keya’ an AI-powered voice bot integrated with Kotak’s phone-banking helpline aimed at augmenting the traditional interactive voice response system in English and Hindi."

The increasing protectionist measures by the US offer an opportunity for US-based steel producers and JSW Steel is taking advantage of its relatively strong balance sheet to ramp up its US presence.

The move will also give JSW a natural hedge for its exports business.

“The acquisition provides a unique opportunity for JSW Steel to establish its presence in the United States and gain deeper access to the North American market,” said a company spokesperson. JSW Steel has been prudent to avoid buying assets at high valuations unlike other peers and has been less aggressive in bidding for Indian steel companies such as and . JSW has got an attractive deal with Acero.

At US$ 180 million enterprise value ($81 million debt and $99 million equity) and assuming capital expenditure of another $50 million, the transaction value implied is about $155 EV/tonne, nearly one third of JSW’s recent brownfield expansions and has got a thumps up from the analysts. This company’s stock price closed up 3 per cent on Monday at ?297.

Acero, which has plants in Ohio, primarily owns 1.5 mtpa of EAF (electric arc furnace) based steel-making capacity and a 3 mtpa hot strip mill capacity. The asset is currently under stress and largely non-operational with revenue of just US$44 million in the past 1.5 years. JSW will have to pump in $50 million to restart operations. The company may also consider more investments to increase the steel capacity (Currently 1.5 mtpa) as it as has excess hot strip mill capacity (3 mtpa) but it said this was subject to market dynamics.

Once fully operational, Acero will add 8 per cent to JSW Steel’s current capacity and the downstream hot strip mill business will take the company closer to customers. Though relatively modest, analysts expect the acquisition to add 10-15 per cent of earnings once fully operational which would add ?20 to ?26 per share.

In the past, JSW has made several acquisitions. While the acquisition of Ispat in 2010 was a major success, it has not been able to meaningfully turn around a US-based plate and pipe mills business it acquired in 2007."

796,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 09:57 AM IST",ET Online,Startups,Riding high: Why Eagle Rider India is a motorcycle rentals firm with a difference,"In 1992, motorcycle and adventure-travel enthusiasts, Chris McIntyre and Jeff Brown quit their corporate jobs to start a business that gave people across the world the opportunity to travel in their respective countries via motorcycle rentals - in the company of guided tours. Decades later, the India chapter began when Eagle Rider India launched in Gurgaon.

Eagle Rider has a vast network of locations, offering a wide variety of motorcycle travel options and membership programme. ""You can be a group of four or five friends that can send us a request to say a 6-day tour of Rajasthan - and customise it for us'"", says Arvind Marwah, COO, Eagle Rider India, adding, ""it's the elevated experience that Eagle Rider is all about.""

The travel experience Eagle Rider offers goes beyond just motorcycling from one place to another. The brand tries to create memorable experiences for the riders. Marwah, fondly called Bob, says, ""We sell dreams, it's the memories that you make on these tours, it's the bonhomie is created between riders.""

The Delhi-NCR chapter of the motorcycle adventure-travel brand has several two-wheeler options on offer including the Harley-Davidson Fat Bob and Sportster 883; the Triumph Bonneville T100, the Royal Enfield Classic 500 and Himalayan for rent. Along with rental bikes, riders get a free open face approved helmet to use through the journey. Customers could also opt for a chase van and a spare motorcycle for a more convenient, hassle-free ride. Eagle Rider also provides the option of arranging for saddle bags, camping gear, tech support, medical and first aid along with other riding gear, cameras and GPS.

Watch: My Big Plunge featuring Arvind Marwah, COO, Eagle Rider India.

Till a few years ago, India may not have registered as a potential market for motorcycle tours, but the arrival of world-class motorcycle rental companies like Eagle Rider is an indication of the steady growth of the luxury two-wheeler segment and more specifically the organised motorcycle tours sector in India.

According to the Global Motorcycle Rental Market 2017-2021 report, in 2015, adventure tourism in India involved about 35% of the domestic tourism industry and wildlife comprised about 40% of the same. Motorcycle rentals are expected to gain even more due to these locations being in places with limited transportation facilities. According to Marwah, the year-on-year sales of luxury motorcycles in India have been on the rise, partly because of the dealerships opening across all parts of the country. This only translates to more opportunities for the brand.

Eagle Rider India also runs an academy that teaches enthusiasts how to ride including women - which happens to be the only one of its kind for the brand. ""We have women who would probably ride in their school or college days and haven't been on a bike since,"" says Trigun Singh Pathania, Chief Instructor for the Eagle Rider Academy.

Mandeep Kohli Merwah, Training Leader for the Academy, started riding only at the age of forty-five, she says, ""No man wants to give you a motorcycle, especially if you are a woman - and also to train you. Because of these challenges, when Eagle Rider came along, I decided that this was the perfect opportunity - which is why the training academy was born.""

The Academy provides motorcycles and riding gear to women riders and an opportunity to train in controlled environments to test their potential. It includes outdoor training and classroom knowledge which is followed by a ride on the highway.

Sharing essential tips of riding in a convoy, Arvind says, ""As soon as you stop seeing the rider behind you in your rear-view, you slow down."" He believes that the thrill of riding a motorcycle is unmatched. Talking about the plunge he took in letting go of his cushy corporate job to follow his passion and launch the first edition of Eagle Rider in India and the mantra he follows, Marwah, a.k.a Bob says, ""If your service is par excellence, the money always follows."""
797,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 09:57 AM IST",,Science,Hubble spots farthest individual star ever seen,"Washington, April 3 (IANS) Setting a new distance record, astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have discovered an enormous blue star nicknamed ""Icarus"", the farthest individual star ever seen.

They also used Icarus to test one theory of dark matter and to probe the make-up of a foreground galaxy cluster, the US space agency said on Tuesday.

""This is the first time we're seeing a magnified, individual star. You can see individual galaxies out there, but this star is at least 100 times farther away than the next individual star we can study, except for supernova explosions,"" explained Patrick Kelly, study leader from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

The star, harboured in a very distant spiral galaxy, is so far away that its light has taken nine billion years to reach Earth.

Icarus, whose official name is ""MACS J1149+2223 Lensed Star 1"", is only visible because it is being magnified by the gravity of a massive galaxy cluster -- located about five billion light-years from Earth.

In gravitational lensing, gravity from a foreground, massive cluster of galaxies acts as a natural lens in space, bending and amplifying light.

The discovery of Icarus through gravitational lensing has initiated a new way for astronomers to study individual stars in distant galaxies.

These observations provide a rare, detailed look at how stars evolve, especially the most luminous stars, NASA said.

Detecting the amplification of a single, pinpoint background star provided a unique opportunity to test the nature of dark matter in the cluster.

Dark matter is an invisible material that makes up most of the universe's mass.

When NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is launched, astronomers expect to find many more stars like Icarus.

""Webb's extraordinary sensitivity will allow measurement of even more details, including whether these distant stars are rotating. Such magnified stars may even be found to be fairly common,"" NASA added.

“With its strong balance sheet and spectrum/network footprint, we believe Bharti Airtel is likely to maintain its leading market share in an intensely competitive but consolidating market,” Manish Adukia, an analyst at Goldman Sachs India, wrote last month.

Airtel has faced pressure from Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which disrupted India’s wireless industry in 2016 by launching free services. Reliance, owned by India’s richest man, Mukesh Abmani, has since started charging, but kept prices low to acquire subscribers. Last week it extended a membership program that offers lower tariffs and free content to subscribers.

“Competitive intensity is unlikely to abate anytime soon,” Gaurav Malhotra, analyst with Citigroup Global Markets wrote in a note on April 1. “We think a pricing recovery is unlikely in the near term.”

801,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:08 AM IST",Bloomberg,International,A wild ride behind the scenes as Saudi crown prince does America,"By Vivian Nereim

The phone call came at 8 p.m. from the Saudi royal court: Come to The Plaza, immediately.

We journalists rushed over to the Manhattan hotel, but it was almost three hours before anything happened. And when it did -- when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Masayoshi Son, Softbank’s chief executive officer, wordlessly signed papers and declared that a “huge step in human history” had been taken -- we had no idea what they were talking about. As the prince left, Son stood still for several long seconds before taking questions.

“What just happened?” I ventured.

The public signing of a Saudi plan to build a $200 billion solar facility was indeed historic. If successful, it will be the world’s largest solar-energy installation by a factor of 100. But no one told us what was going on as we sat on the floor (no chairs). It was just another day -- or night -- in the chaotic life of the hundreds of officials, business figures and communications consultants who are trailing the heir to the Saudi throne around the world as he tries to drum up investment and boost his country’s image. He’s in the middle of a three-week U.S. visit. After Washington, Boston and New York, the delegation headed to the West Coast for meetings with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the heads of Amazon, Apple, Google and Uber.

Visa Rush

The trip got off to a madcap start when the Saudis applied at the last minute for more than 500 U.S. visas, according to a person familiar with the matter. As organizers weighed whether to allow media access to a gala dinner in Washington, I was invited, dis-invited and then re-invited.

At least three government entities, along with outside firms, are involved in coordinating press coverage of the visit but information has been scarce. Journalists gleaned the outline of the prince’s schedule -– when he would travel to different cities, who would accompany him and whom he would meet –- through rumors and anonymous sources.

Part of the tension appears to be over how much to publicize -- and how much change the Saudi public can handle. While in New York, Prince Mohammed met with pro-Israel leaders in the U.S., including from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the American Jewish Committee. But the participants were sworn to secrecy. Meanwhile, another meeting he held in New York, with religious figures including Roman Catholic clergy and two rabbis, was heralded by the Saudi embassy as inter-religious dialogue that “emphasized the common bond among all people, particularly people of faith.”

Asked about the unannounced meeting, one Saudi government representative didn’t respond while a second referred back to the press release about the interfaith gathering without further comment.

Glazed Eyes

The prince is in a hurry to remake the once fiercely closed-off Islamic kingdom, diversifying its economy away from oil and loosening social restrictions even as he tightens his political grip over the authoritarian state. He’s famous for working long hours and late nights, as the glazed eyes of the employees arranging his trip can attest. He’d barely finished official visits to Egypt and the U.K. when he jetted to Washington.

Some chaos is inevitable on a trip of such scale. But it’s also a symptom of the growing pains Saudi Arabia is going through as its secretive government pledges more transparency -- crucial in the lead-up to the initial public offering of as much as 5 percent of state oil company Saudi Aramco. For a society that has long valued discretion, a road show promoting openness is a bit of an alien concept.

The Saudi government has undeniably opened up during the past few years, issuing a slew of visas for foreign journalists and appointing spokesmen where none existed. In New York, Prince Mohammed met with reporters and editors at the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, albeit mostly off the record.

“We have committed to increasing the level of transparency and accountability,” said Husameddin AlMadani, head of Saudi Arabia’s National Center for Performance Management, a government agency that measures progress on the targets set by the prince. “It helps investors. It helps think tanks and researchers.”

How that will play out is far from clear as officials lurch between traditional silence and promises of openness. The result is often a bizarre blend, a kind of twilight zone where something -- it’s just not always clear what -- is being announced. That’s what happened last week at the Plaza at midnight. As quickly as it started, the event was over. Reporters were left to meander past the closed bar and dishes of Saudi dates, observing a handful of delegates working into the morning hours."

In fact, given the uncertainty over the pace of recovery in earnings, the markets are expected to be range-bound or fall further. To deal with such uncertainty, it makes sense to be with schemes that focus on large-sized companies because they may not fall as much as mid- and small-sized ones. Also, large-sized companies are better equipped to deal with high market volatility. Among large-cap schemes, Birla Sun Life Top 100 stands out as a good investment option.

Addressing the event to mark the 60th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's arrival in India, Madhav stated India has always hosted people in difficult times with an open heart. ""We know the life of a refugee is very tough...we hosted many people in trouble. India always welcome with open hands and open heart those in difficulties.""

It is not immediately clear why the Centre allowed a minister and senior member of the ruling party to attend the event just a little over a month after MEA issued a directive to all ministries, advising senior officials not to get associated with the program in the backdrop of tactical outreach to China ahead of the summit meet between the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping.

It could be speculated that Beijing may not have fully reciprocated India’s gesture, especially with regard to the transgressions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)- a bone of contention between the two South Asian majors."

The bulls had a rollicking day yesterday, with benchmarks rallying up to 1 per cent. The BSE Sensex added 287 points, or 0.87 per cent at 33,255. The Nifty added 98 points, or 0.97 per cent, to shut shop at 10,212. Of the 50 scrips on the NSE index, 39 ended in the green.

The chart reflected the mood. The momentum indicator moving average convergence divergence, more popularly known as MACD, signalled upward crossovers for 228 stocks on the NSE.

MACD is a pointer to identifying trend reversals.

Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Lupin, Apex Frozen Foods NSE 0.48 %, Reddy's Labs and Hero MotoCorp are among stocks that flashed bullish crossovers. Some of these counters have been witnessing strong volumes, lending credence to the emerging trend.

Others showing a similar movement included Infibeam Incorp, Adani Power, HDIL, Unitech, Navkar Corporation L, Jamna Auto Inds and Aurobindo Pharma.

MACD is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the 'signal' line, is plotted on top of MACD to reflect 'buy' or 'sell' opportunities.

When MACD goes below the signal line, it throws a bearish signal on the chart, indicating that the price of the security may move down, and vice versa.


The catch is MACD alone may not be self-sufficient to help firm up an investment call.


Traders need to make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and stochastic to confirm any trend. Retail investors should consult a financial expert before buying or selling a stock based on such technical indicators, analysts said.

According to MACD charts, eight stocks were in the grip of bearish crossovers on the NSE, which means a ‘sell’ signal. These include Axis Bank, PC Jeweller L, Astra Microwave, TV Today Network NSE -0.82 % and CL Educate.


Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities noted that the index has been making lower tops and lower bottoms on the weekly scale and it needs to surpass its 61.80 per cent retracement of 10,276 to offset any short-term negativity.

The barometer has been moving in a descending channel since it hit a high of 10,631 on February 27, whose breakout point is placed around the 10,260 level. ""Once the Nifty50 registers a decisive breakout above the said channel, it shall strengthen the case for a durable bottom around the 9,950 level. Traders should otherwise expect modest targets of around 10,350,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

Understanding MACD

A close look at the chart of Lupin shows whenever the MACD line has got above the signal line, the stock has always shown an upward momentum, and vice versa. The stock closed 5.30 per cent higher at Rs 775.40 on Monday."
813,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:29 AM IST",TNN,Defence,India bracing for a 'hot' summer on China front after Doklam crisis,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 02, 2018)
HAYULIANG/KIBITHU: Indian security forces are bracing for a “hot” summer in the Himalayas along the Line of Actual Control with China this year. But unlike the Line of Control with Pakistan, where cross-border firing duels is the norm, it will be a battle of nerves in the shape of troop face-offs and transgressions without actual shots being fired on the China front.

The assessment by the Indian defence establishment is that at least half of the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” identified on the 4,057-km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, are “likely to witness renewed muscle-flexing” by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with winter ebbing away now.

The two countries continue to maintain high operational alertness on their borders, with additional units deployed in forward areas, despite troop disengagement from the 73-day face-off at Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction last year.

With Chinese troops having now permanently occupied the Bhutanese territory of north Doklam by constructing bunkers, hutments, roads and helipads to sustain their troops in the area, the number of PLA “transgressions” across the LAC into what India perceives to be its territory has also shown a significant jump. If 273 transgressions (military euphemism for incursions) were recorded in 2016, the number touched 426 last year.

“We are keeping a close watch on the Chinese activity. We are also conducting regular and special long-range patrols (LRPs) to the 18 mountain passes in the region to physically dominate the LAC,” said a senior officer of 2 Infantry Mountain Division, responsible for “maintaining the sanctity” of the 386-km stretch of the LAC in the rugged terrain of Dibang, Dau-Delai and Lohit Valleys in Arunachal Pradesh.

Indian troops, of course, also conduct “aggressive patrolling’’ in all the three sectors of the LAC -- western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) – to strengthen claims to disputed territories. “In fact, we patrol much more than the PLA,” said an officer.

The rival troops often leave behind “tell-tale signs” in the shape of cigarette packets and cans or painted rocks to declare it their territory. “If the rival troops come face-to-face, there are laid down steps like banner drills to defuse the situation. Issues on the LAC are resolved through established mechanisms like border personnel meetings, flag meetings and hotline calls,” said another officer.

But the confrontations can get quite prolonged like they did during the Depsang and Chumar face-offs in eastern Ladakh in 2013-2014. The disputed areas in Ladakh range from Trig Heights, Demchok and Dumchele to Chumar, Spanggur Gap and Pangong Tso.

In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and Dibang Valley. In the Dibang Valley, the hotspots are the so-called “Fish Tail-I and II” areas, which take their name from the shape the LAC takes in the region. In the middle sector, in turn, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La."

816,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:27 AM IST",Bloomberg,Startups,Virgin Hyperloop One revamps board; director arrested,"By Sarah McBride and Giles Turner

Virgin Hyperloop One replaced three directors and a fourth was arrested, the latest signs of turmoil at the futuristic transportation startup.

A list of directors that was updated on the company’s website Monday showed three members stepped down from the 10-person board: Jim Messina, a former adviser to President Barack Obama; Jim Rosenthal, a former Morgan Stanley executive; and Peter Diamandis, founder of X Prize.New board members are Bill Shor of Caspian Venture Capital; Yuvraj Narayan, chief financial officer of DP World; and Anatoly Braverman of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. The changes were made several weeks ago, a person familiar with the situation said.

A fourth board member, Russian billionaire Ziyavudin Magomedov, was arrested in Moscow on charges of fraud and embezzlement unrelated to Hyperloop. Marvin Ammori, the general counsel, also left the startup recently, people familiar with the matter said. He was replaced by Laura Lariu, now acting general counsel. Neither the company nor Ammori responded to requests for comment. Magomedov is appealing the arrest, his lawyer told Interfax.

The changes come as Hyperloop tries to steer itself out of a bumpy situation. Co-Founder Shervin Pishevar took a leave of absence in December after Bloomberg reported on multiple claims of sexual misconduct. He denied all allegations of inappropriate conduct. Virgin’s Richard Branson replaced Pishevar as chairman. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that chief financial officer Brent Callinicos had left that position. Carl Jenkins, the senior vice president for hardware engineering, also departed.

Late last year, the company raised $50 million as it was running low on cash. It’s now making a big push to win a contract to build the first commercial version of its proposed transportation system, which is like a train but much faster. It’s eyeing possible sites for development, including Dubai. On Sunday, Branson and Chief Executive Officer Rob Lloyd hosted Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at a Virgin Galactic U.S. facility in the Mojave Desert, where they showed off a Virgin Hyperloop One pod—similar to a train carriage.

The long-term status of Magomedov’s board seat is unclear after his unrest over the weekend. Magomedov was co-chairman with Pishevar before Branson stepped in, and his firm, Caspian Venture Capital, is a major backer. Before the Virgin deal, Caspian made an unsuccessful offer to buy the company."
817,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:32 AM IST",TNN,Economy,Nearly 1 crore new tax filers added in 2017-18,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 03, 2018)
NEW DELHI: More Indians are now filing tax returns with nearly one crore new filers joining the system in 2017-18 as the revenue department reported robust increase in direct tax receipts.

The tax department said during 2017-18, 6.8 crore income tax returns were filed - up 26 per cent from previous year's 5.4 crore returns. There has been a significant increase in the number of I-T returns filed in the last four years on the back of a sustained drive undertaken by the government to expand the tax base and its campaign against black money.

The rollout of goods and services tax (GST) is expected to help boost revenues on the indirect taxes front. Healthy increase in direct tax receipts helped the revenue department cross the Budget estimates for 2017-18. Direct tax receipts totalled Rs 9.9 lakh crore, up 17.1 per cent than the net collections of 2016-17. The net direct tax receipts represent 101.5 per cent of the Budget estimates of Rs 9.8 lakh crore and 99 per cent of the revised estimates of Rs 10 lakh crore in 2017-18.

""I hope this Rs 9.9 lakh crore will reach up to more than Rs 10 lakh crore. At least in next three to four days, we will get adjustment of Rs 5,000 crore. It will be a landmark if we achieve Rs 10-lakh-crore figure in current year,"" finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia, who is also the revenue secretary, told a news conference.


CBDT chairman Sushil Chandra said more collections are likely to come and help raise the figures and attributed the robust receipts to the government's efforts to use data and information to rope in new taxpayers.

""This was because of continuous follow-up by our department. We have issued a large number of SMSs, emails on the basis of data with us. Because of which, new returns have come and around Rs 13,000 crore of self-assessment tax has come in last two months due to continuous follow-up by the department,"" he said. ""In non-intrusive manner, we have intimated to the assessees about their assets, properties and that's why they have filed returns,"" Chandra said.

Tax authorities added that revenues from GST have remained buoyant after a dip in December. The March data showed that it was hitting the Rs 90,000-crore mark.

Adhia expressed confidence of meeting the fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, due to recovery in revenue receipts - both in the direct and indirect tax segments.

""On the whole, this year (2017-18) has been very good. Although it was a year of uncertainty for revenue due to the implementation of the goods and services tax and other reforms, we have still broadly met revenue targets, and are on course of meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 per cent,"" Adhia said.

He said the e-way bill has been rolled out successfully and has been glitch-free, while GSTN has coped well. From April 1, it has become mandatory to register on the e-way bill system for all interstate movement of goods."

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is facing a crippling staff shortage with an average 50% of posts lying vacant across departments. A report highlighting the crisis shows that the shortfall in 20 key departments ranges from 20% (power) to as much as 87% (law).

Government sources say the situation is grave and can impact implementation of key projects. At a time when public transport is seen as the answer to Delhi’s pollution problem, the transport department has a huge 62.7% staff shortfall. Almost half the posts are vacant in revenue; excise, entertainment and luxury taxes; social welfare; education; statistics and economics; and planning.

The public works department, which has the task of implementing and maintaining infrastructure projects, is grappling with an almost 40% staff shortage. This data is learned to have been compiled for an assessment of the governance challenge facing the state and is likely to be part of a white paper on the “performance” of the lieutenant governor.



Govt says budget goals not met due to vacancies


The document, put together by the political executive, is expected to be tabled in the Delhi assembly on Tuesday by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. Reliable sources told TOI that a significant part of the report is dedicated to the services department that handles the bureaucracy.

The white paper will be the Arvind Kejriwal-led government’s latest political salvo. It will argue that with the LG in charge of “services”, as stated by the Delhi high court in an August 4, 2016 order, the AAP government finds itself helpless when it comes to appointing, selecting, transferring and posting staff, besides expediting recruitments.

Interestingly, a majority of these vacancies actually pertain to posts that are to be filled through examinations and selection by the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) of Delhi government. In the light of HC’s judgment, the AAP government has been arguing that all services-related matters now fall in the LG’s jurisdiction, including the accountability of DSSSB.

Sources claimed that the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues have written to the LG regarding the vacancies and that it is now the responsibility of the LG to fill the vacancies. Education being a priority for the AAP government, sources pointed out that the number of sanctioned positions for teachers is 66,128 but only 34211 regular teachers are currently employed. This means that there are over 30,000 vacancies in the schools of the directorate of education. “Of the 76 posts for deputy directors of education (DDE), only 14 are currently filled.

When a large-scale audit of accounts of the private schools was to be conducted, the deputy chief minister requested for 12 DANICS officers to be deputed as DDEs for this purpose. Not only did the LG fail to provide this manpower, he never responded to the government’s letter, government sources alleged.

In this context, the political brass cites the outcome budget 2017-18 that was tabled in the ongoing budget session to point out that several departments have not been able to achieve their proposed outcomes. “An important reason for this seems to be the unusually large number of vacancies in all departments,” sources said."

The All India Pre-Medical Test conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education in 2015 was cancelled by the Supreme Court. The high marks given by the board in the Class XII exams in 2016 drew a lot of flak.

And while 2017 was dogged by big marks calculation errors in the board exams, this year saw the question paper leaks. Experts have observed this downslide in the past few years and attribute it to the non-sustenance of the reforms in examination and evaluation that CBSE initiated after the National Curriculum Framework in 2005.

Professor Krishna Kumar, former director of NCERT, said these controversies point at problems within the education board. “Under chairman Ashok Ganguly, CBSE started work in 2005 to improve the evaluation system and revamp the system of setting question papers, but gave up too soon,” Kumar said. “CBSE should have created space for thoughtful answers instead of textbook answers, but that requires direction and it did not happen. After 2009-10, the momentum was lost.”

Kumar added that the Indian public examination system anyway lacked credibility because of the marking system and practice of having module answers by which to judge students. “Our system has sanctioned this, and every year there are cases of children getting their answer sheets re-evaluated because they feel they have not been treated fairly,” he pointed out. “This year, CBSE created more uncertainty among the students on whether their hard work was being rewarded.”


Ganguly himself felt this year’s examination fiasco was an aberration. “The faith in the infallibility of the system may have led to this situation,” Ganguly said. Citing the pioneering system of having multiple sets of question papers, which many state boards too adopted, the former CBSE chairman reasoned, “CBSE discontinued multiple sets in 2018 without thing it much thought. Had we followed the multiple set system, the severity of the leaks would have been reduced and it would also have pinpointed the mischief monger.”

National Curriculum Framework outlined measures for exam reforms and CBSE should have not only sustained the changes, but improved upon them, said Ganguly.

Many felt that the question paper leaks were organised attempts to malign the existing set-up. “While it is premature to speculate about such motives while the investigation into the origin, methodology and intent behind the leak are under way, it is nevertheless obvious that the big-bang is pretty well organised and its primary intent is to malign the system that has worked for decades with impeccable records, efficiency and credentials,” asserted Ashok Pandey, principal, Ahlcon International School, Mayur Vihar.

Pandey said asking for the head of the CBSE chairperson would not address the problems at hand. He said that going forward, the education board needed to “revisit the assessment process, introduce reforms, integrate technology and bring uniformity in the evaluation system” from Class I to XII. “The continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) system, therefore, was not such a bad idea. But we discarded it abruptly,” Pandey rued.

Professor Janaki Rajan, department of teacher training, Jamia Millia Islamia, pointed out another drawback. “CBSE no longer has academic presence which is crucial to understand curricular, pedagogic evaluation and measurement dimensions,” he said. “These require research-based organic and child-centred approaches rather than administrative and logistic approaches.”"

826,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:46 AM IST",Bloomberg,Stocks,US stocks would bear the brunt of an escalating global trade war,"By Komal Sri-Kumar

Trade-related topics that had been a sleeper have become a front-burner issue for investors. Equity prices and Treasury yields plunged March 23 after the US announcement of a 25 per cent tariff on up to $60 billion of Chinese exports. Over that weekend, both sides expressed interest in reconciling differences and markets reversed path when they opened March 26.

If a global trade war erupts, investors should allocate more of their assets to Treasury securities that are likely to experience a further decline in yields. Equities, meanwhile, would bear the brunt of the impact of tit-for-tat trade moves by the US and its major trade-partners.

Would the outcome for bonds be different if China, the US’s largest foreign creditor, follows through on its threat to sell some of its $1.2 trillion holdings of Treasuries? Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the US, would not rule out this possibility in a Bloomberg Television interview on March 23. Such a move would still not prevent a decline in bond yields because it would also cause global investors to rush to havens.

Happily, there is a path that would reconcile the US’s political objectives and the requirements of global investors. President Donald Trump could achieve his campaign promise of boosting economic growth and creating jobs by expanding markets rather than restricting imports. Such measures would help bring about greater market share for US companies and be welcomed by markets.

The first step was taken by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. In a letter to Liu He, China’s economic czar, they asked for a reduction in tariffs on automobiles, increased purchases of US semiconductors and a further opening of the Chinese financial sector for American companies.

Investor concern eased over the weekend when the official Xinhua News Agency reported that Liu had expressed concern that a trade war would hurt both countries and sought steps to reach a compromise. Exports account for about 20 per cent of China’s gross domestic product, and restrictions could significantly slow the pace of economic growth.

The relief of investors is unlikely to last in the absence of concrete measures to open markets. Bloomberg Politics said Tuesday that the Trump administration may restrict Chinese investments in sensitive areas of the technology sector. The report was a major factor in the 2.9 per cent decrease of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index that day.

Nor should investors expect much support from the agreement reached last week with South Korea to allow increased sales of US automobiles in South Korea.

The deal provides no indication whether market-expanding measures will be part of any accord that the US could reach with the European Union regarding tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The EU has received an exemption until May 1, and US tariffs may yet be imposed if talks do not progress.

The South Korean agreement would also be far outweighed in economic importance by the substantially larger volume of trade flowing between US and China, and by US trade with its North American Free Trade Agreement partners, Canada and Mexico. The three parties are attempting to revise the accord. How these disputes are settled is likely to weigh on the performance of financial markets.

The outcome of these talks will be telling for investors. If tariffs are imposed on German cars entering the US, if Nafta talks collapse or if China imposes a tariff on a major US export, soybeans , you should sell equities and make Treasuries your friend.

An alternate route would have positive market consequences. An agreement between the EU and the US on a wider market opening for companies would be a major boost to global equities. Also watch whether US companies are allowed to enter Chinese markets without being forced to take on local partners. If it is confirmed that US negotiators have dropped the demand that automobiles must have a 50 per cent US content to benefit from Nafta is confirmed, buy North American equities.

Recent market performance shows investors that global trade policy is more potent than the US fiscal stimulus announced in December. Increased allocation of assets to equities has to be based on a clear signal that officials are involved in expanding trade rather than reducing it."
827,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:01 AM IST",TNN,Sports,Commonwealth Games 2018: Indians feel the sting as 'Syringegate' turns ugly,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 03, 2018)
GOLD COAST/NEW DELHI: Indian athletes have been hit hard by the syringe controversy in Gold Coast (Australia) with the Commonwealth Games organisers targeting all arriving batches of Indians for dope testing.

Following the recovery of a used syringe outside the room of a seasoned boxer at the Athletes’ Village on Friday, all boxers were asked to give their urine samples for testing. On Monday, it was the turn of the gymnastics contingent, while the weightlifters were tested late on Sunday.

In what is being seen as a fall-out of the breach of the No-Needle Policy of CWG, the Indian athletes have been cornered by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency (ASADA) to give their samples on their arrival at the Athletes’ Village – even before checking into their respective rooms. The message from the organisers to Australia’s anti-doping officials for Indian athletes is clear – spot them, test them. India has sent a 225-member athletes’ contingent to Gold Coast.

While it’s normal for the host country’s anti-doping watchdog to collect samples of all participating athletes to ensure that the Games remain clean, the manner in which the organisers and ASADA officials are going about their business is something unprecedented and unheard of.

Indian athletes are facing a tough time evading the suspicion-filled eyes of the anti-doping officials, an Indian coach said. “Athletes wanted to rest in their rooms after a long flight, but here they were asked to give their samples even before settling down properly. It’s not only harsh on these athletes, but embarrassing as well. Just because of the fault of some athlete (read boxer), the entire contingent is being looked upon with suspicion,” the coach told TOI.

Sources even said that there are rumours that some ASADA officials have mingled with the village house-keeping staff to keep an eye on the athletes.

It seems that after the syringe was found stuffed in a crushed plastic bottle in the bin outside the boxer’s room, the organisers want to leave nothing to chance to keep the Games dope-free. They have already informed that a decision on the said boxer’s further participation would be taken before the opening ceremony on April 4. While the boxer has denied any such alleged involvement, team officials have reportedly admitted to the use of syringe but for a ‘medical purpose’.

India’s boxing high performance director Santiago Nieva informed that the syringe was used to administer “vitamin substance” to an ill boxer. However, Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) chief executive David Grevemberg has said it is a “clear breach” of the No-Needle Policy inside the village.

It’s pertinent to mention here that ASADA had entered into an agreement with India’s National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) last year to share whereabouts of athletes as part of their pre-CWG dope operation.

The ASADA team had reportedly collected the urine samples of Indian Greco-Roman wrestlers participating at the Asian Championships in New Delhi in May last year and had even visited Patiala’s National Institute of Sport (NIS) to collect samples of CWG probables.

WHAT IS NO-NEEDLE POLICY
Needles must not be used except by medically qualified practitioners for treatment of injury, illness or other medical conditions (for which a valid TUE may be required) those requiring auto-injection therapy for an established medical condition with a valid TUE, e.g. for insulin dependent diabetes.

• Every Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) must ensure that needles are stored in a central secured location, access to which is restricted to authorized medical personnel of the CGA delegation.

• Athletes with a valid TUE for use of insulin, and non-athletes requiring other forms of auto-injection may keep appropriate materials with them if safely stored and disposed of in accordance with the following:

• All used needles and associated materials (vials, syringes, and swabs) are disposed of in an appropriate bio-hazards container

• Whenever an athlete receives an injection during the Games, the attached “Injection Declaration Form” (IDF) is duly completed and forwarded to the CGF Medical Commission no later than noon the day following such injection.

• No IDF is required if the injection has been administered by a medically qualified practitioner from the CWG organising committee and the injection has been recorded. Acupuncture or the use of dry needling techniques is exempt from IDFs.

• Failure to respect the policy or IDFs could lead to disciplinary action, sanctions and testing for the CGA and the athlete.

• There is no medical justification for any athlete (except those with valid TUE), a coach or any other non-medically qualified person to administer an injection.

831,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:03 AM IST",ET Bureau,Panache,Changing beauty routine can help your skin stay cool this summer,"By Rashmi Ramesh

Summer brings with it beach visits, vacations and extended hours of daylight, but along come a host of skin issues too, such as tanning, sunburn and dryness. Keeping such things at bay requires care both from the inside and on the outside.

Dr Shireen Furtado, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic and laser physician at Aster CMI, Bengaluru, said every season is associated with its own peculiar range of skin issues.

“Come summer, fungal skin infections, especially in the folds of the skin such as groin, armpits and under the mammary area, are quite common due to increased temperature coupled with sweat and poor personal hygiene. This can lead to recurrent fungal infections that are particularly tenacious and difficult to eliminate,” she said.


Dr Vijayalakshmi Sujay, cosmetologist and dermatologist at Shree Clinic in Bengaluru said that contagious viral infections such as chicken pox as well as conditions like impetigo are also quite common.

“On the cosmetology side of it, skin tanning, dryness or peeling of the skin, bromhidrosis (offensive body odour caused largely due to excessive sweating) and increase in acne on the face and back due to sun exposure are common,” she said.

BUILD A CARE REGIMEN

Taking care of your skin is vital, especially during the hot and humid summers, said Dr Mukta Sachdev, consultant dermatologist at Bengaluru's Manipal Hospital. “Bathing daily and using anti-fungal dusting powders can help prevent several conditions,” she said. It is also important to modify your skincare routine during summer – it is not necessary that the creams you have been using during the dry winter season will work just as well now, according to her.

“Using a mild face wash to clean your face more frequently will help prevent oil and sebum accumulation – you may need to change your face wash and use one more suited for oily skin in this season,” Sachdev said.

“Additionally, using a mild scrub, exfoliating cream or microdermabrasion cream is beneficial. However, you must remember not to go overboard – be gentle with yo
ur skin and do not use these products more than once or twice a week. Astringents and toners will aid in cleansing, makeup removal and removing the grease and dirt following outdoor activities, which are more prevalent in the summer,” she said.

For physical protection against the harmful UV rays, Furtado advised wearing close-weave, lightcoloured cotton clothes in pastel colours, wearing a wide-brimmed hat (whose brim is at least four inches wide) and carrying umbrellas with reflective silver coating on the inside. Sujay said that wearing light-coloured cotton clothes and natural fabrics that cover a major part of your body is recommended as it not only prevents tanning but also helps keep acne in check.

“Wearing tight or synthetic clothes can aggravate acne on the body and also cause folliculitis. Apart from that, taking a good vitamin supplement will boost immunity, splashing plain water on your face at regular intervals (about four to six times a day) keeps skin fresh and dirt-free and staying in a well-ventilated and dry area is helpful,” she said. Cautioning that bleaching skin to get rid of the tan is not a good idea, Sujay said, “If you bleach your skin and don’t use good sun protection, the chemicals present in the bleaches can cause irritation, aggravate dryness and lead to even more tanning.”


Experts said that one of the most important preventive measures to avoid skin damage is to use sunscreen liberally.

“Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of approximately 30 and above. It is important to reapply your sunscreen every two-three hours and make sure you use an adequate amount over the sun-exposed areas,” Sachdev said, adding that it is best to consult a skin specialist and use a sunscreen that is best suited for your skin type and lifestyle. Furtado said that sunscreens with both UVA and UVB protection are best-suited for the season.

AC ISN'T SKIN- FRIENDLY

Although air-conditioners provide relief from the scorching heat, the coolness comes with its own set of problems. “AC dries out the skin and dry skin is more prone to UV-induced damage. One way to surpass this is to use a light moisturiser with SPF as well as a water-mist spray to refresh the skin,” said Furtado.

Sachdev said that oil-free, water-based moisturisers with SPF are best suited for this season. “Using moisturisers fortified with actives such as hyaluronic acid help hold water and prevent dry and itchy skin that the extreme temperatures bring,” she said. “Due to extreme temperature shifts of the hotness outside and the chilly temperature inside offices, the skin can become dry and irritated. Using a moisturiser not only soothes it, but also helps create a barrier to protect the skin from further damage.”

The importance of fluids, especially water, cannot be overemphasised if you are in an AC setting constantly. Drinking at least two litres of water and eating a lot of seasonal fruits that have good water content go a long way in protecting your skin. You can also drink coconut water – even splashing some of it on your face from time to time nourishes the skin, Sujay said.

HOLIDAYING? KEEP THESE IN MIND

If you are going to the beach or travelling to a hot place for a holiday, be sure to carry a sunscreen, which should be applied to a clean and dry skin at least 15 minutes before going outdoors.

“Remember to reapply the sunscreen after swimming or perspiring. Typically, one ounce of sunscreen lotion is enough to cover exposed areas of the body properly. An added advantage of sunscreen is that it will prevent premature ageing of your skin. Using a lip balm with SPF will keep your lips hydrated while preventing them from burning and chapping. Wearing UV-protective sun glasses will protect your eyes and prevent wrinkles too,” said Sachdev.


“These rules do not apply only to women – they are also for men and children.

Men’s skin is actually oilier than women’s, which means that men should be taking more care of their skin during the summer. As for children above six months of age, they can use sunscreens specially formulated for kids,” she said.

WHEN TO SEE A DERMATOLOGIST

The minute you see excessive tanning you can’t get rid of and an increase in acne conditions, it is best to consult a doctor, said Sujay.

Sachdev said that if you have excessive burning, itching, rashes or discomfort, see a dermatologist. “It is advisable to consult a dermatologist before it becomes too uncomfortable to avoid a flare-up of skin rashes and prevent any eczematisation and secondary infections of the skin,” she said.

An itchy groin rash that does not go away generally signifies a fungal infection and you should consult a doctor to treat it, said Furtado. “Please refrain from using over-the-counter antifungal creams as most of them have very potent topical steroids that do not help resolve the infection, but cause further resistance to front-line antifungal agents,” she said."
832,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:52 AM IST",TOI Contributor,Services,"View: It is our children’s future, not our ancestor’s pride, that deserves our outrage first","By Anustup Nayak

Here is a sample of what has outraged Indians over the last year: a violent mob attacked a bus full of schoolchildren to protect the honour of a mythical queen. Riots erupted between caste groups over a battle fought two hundred years ago. Young people were killed for falling in love outside their faith and for eating the meat of their choice.

We are willing to die and kill for dead queens, sacred animals, and caste history, all symbols of our past. But why is our response so muted when it comes to our children and youth, who symbolize our future?

Angry high-school students are out protesting on Delhi streets over the leaked Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) grade 10th and 12th question papers. Data analysis conducted by Geeta Kingdon shows that between 2004 and 2016, the median percentage score in CBSE's school leaving examinations have been systematically inflated by 8%. Only 40% of our 14-18-year-olds can calculate the price of a shirt sold at a 10% discount and less than 60% could read the time from an analog clock, according to the findings of the Annual Status of Education (ASER) report. And, less than 17% of India's graduates are employable.

None of these revelations are new. We have known for years that our education system is failing. Children are going to school but not learning much beyond “floor level tasks.” Yet, there has been no big bang policy shift, very little sustained media scrutiny and indeed no parent uprising.

Why does the bleak future of our young people not stoke our collective outrage?

Students, parents and employers all benefit from good education. But they lack the voice to press for change. Politicians, bureaucrats, and media can influence education from the outside, but they find it of no use to advance their agendas.

Till recently, the software outsourcing industry boomed. Companies flocked to hire at campuses of even second rate engineering colleges. Most of these graduates are ill equipped to do entry level jobs. Corporations spend months to reskill them rather than getting entangled in lobbying government to fix college teaching.

Politicians do not win elections, or bureaucrats get promotions on an education platform. It takes years for good education policies to show results and even for bad ones to fail. Few in public office have that kind of patience to sow and wait. Fewer have the gumption to take on the entrenched unions, cartels, and ideologues who block meaningful change in schools and colleges.

Children are the most important beneficiaries of a good education yet the ones with least power to shape it. When children are in school, they are either unaware of how little they are learning or afraid to speak up. College students sometimes raise their voices in protest, but mostly on issues tangential to their learning.

Parents choose to exit the school system rather than pressuring it to change. Millions of parents pull their children out of broken government schools and enroll them in low-fee private schools. Then they find out that even private schools do not deliver much better results. The better-off among them find refuge in tuition centres. The rest make do with what they get.

However, this pattern of exiting without a voice need not be fait accompli for Indian education. “The time for the richer Indian to secede has come to an end,” notes philanthropist Rohini Nilekani in her article for this column “The end of secession” (13 November 2017). “The foul air in Delhi is a perfect example of a great leveller. Rich and poor alike must breathe in its health hazards,” Nilekani argues.

The leak of CBSE question papers may be the fateful “foul air moment” for Indian education. Fates of children living in Gurgaon skyscrapers hangs in uncertain balance alongside their mofussil peers. Consider this. There will soon be 100 million under-skilled and under-employed young people on our streets. Many will be desperate, leading them to harass, loot, and molest, or to harm themselves if not others. A student commits suicide every hour in India, unable to fulfill aspirations, cope with failure, or find emotional support, according to IndiaSpend reports.

Would we keep quiet if these were your children or mine? Will they find a college of their choice? Will they qualify for a job when they graduate? How will we grow our businesses when there are so few skilled people to hire? What India story will we sell to attract foreign investors? What myth will politicians spin to get the disillusioned to vote this time?

Now is the time to cry out for an excellent education for every child.

Parents, students, and employers must demand that our institutions deliver real capability and not empty certificates. Let us stamp our vote to those leaders who can make this happen. Let us not keep quiet till we get what we deserve. But with the right to raise our voices comes the responsibility to stay invested. Media must capture this moment and ensure that those in power heed this call. It must hold them accountable for action.

It is our children’s future, not our ancestor’s pride, that deserves our outrage first. Only then can we begin to unleash the potential of our 100 million young minds.

833,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 10:53 AM IST",Bloomberg,Stocks,Rational markets theory keeps running into irrational humans,"By Noah Smith

To many young people, the idea of efficient financial markets -- the idea that, in the words of economist Eugene Fama, “at any point in time, the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value” -- probably seems like a joke. The financial crisis of 2008, the bursting of the housing bubble and gyrations in markets from gold to Bitcoin to Chinese stocks have put paid, at least for now, to the idea that prices are guided by the steady hand of rationality. The theory won Fama an economics Nobel prize in 2013, but he shared it with Robert Shiller, whose research poked significant holes in the idea decades ago.

But believe it or not, there was a time when efficient markets theory occupied a place of honor in the worldview of economists and financial professionals alike. This is chronicled in my colleague Justin Fox’s excellent book, “The Myth of the Rational Market: A History of Risk, Reward, and Delusion on Wall Street.” Though Fama did empirical research that seemed to support market efficiency, at its core the idea is based on fairly simple logic -- if people consistently buy assets for more than its fundamental value, they’ll lose money. If people lose money, they’ll be pushed out of the market, and only investors who tend to pay the right price -- often referred to as “rational arbitrageurs” in economics papers -- will remain. Economist Milton Friedman legendarily stated this idea in 1953 when he wrote: People who argue that speculation is destabilizing seldom realize that this is largely equivalent to saying that speculators lose money, since speculation can be destabilizing in general only if speculators on the average sell when [an asset] is low in price and buy when it is high.

This logic is simple and compelling, but it doesn’t have to be true. In the real world, people who trade based on fundamentals don’t have infinite resources -- short-selling on the expectation that a stock will fall in price is expensive and risky, borrowing shares to place those bets costs money and financial backers can withdraw their money before a trade pays off. Because of these limits, trading against a mispricing isn’t true arbitrage, because, as economist and investor John Maynard Keynes is said to have quipped, “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”

In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, economists pushed back strongly against the idea of efficient markets. Keynes’ remark was formalized into economic theory by J. Bradford De Long, Andrei Shleifer, Lawrence Summers and Robert Waldmann in 1989. The idea was that so-called noise traders -- a coordinated herd of investors who either overpay or underpay for a financial asset -- can act in concert to push prices out of line with fundamentals. With their limited resources, rational arbitrageurs can’t always risk pushing back against the irrational tide -- sometimes, like a movie character who throws down his shotgun and runs when faced with an onrushing gang of zombies, rational traders can end up moving in the same direction as the speculators. When this happens, the noise traders can actually make money and remain in the market, defying Friedman’s formulation.

It’s a compelling idea. But it’s very hard to test because it’s hard to observe rational arbitrageurs in action. Typically, no one knows which trades are placed by the rational folks, and which are by misinformed speculators.

A recent paper, however, does something along those lines. In “ETF Arbitrage and Return Predictability,” economists David Brown, Shaun Davies and Matthew Ringgenberg take advantage of the way exchange-traded funds are structured. An ETF typically has a designated set of traders called “authorized participants” (APs) who are able to carry out arbitrage between the fund and its underlying assets, whether stocks, bonds or commodities. When the price changes, APs respond by buying and selling the underlying assets, and by either creating or redeeming shares of the ETF, until the two values come back into line. They are, by design, rational arbitrageurs.

Generally, an ETF’s APs do a good job of keeping the fund’s value close to the value of the assets it owns. Many studies confirm this. But Brown et al. find that APs’ arbitrage coincides with a deviation of asset values from their fundamentals.

When traders other than the APs push around the price -- the changes in the prices of the assets tend to reverse themselves over the subsequent months. Anyone watching the APs’ arbitrage trades -- which are public record, since they involve the creation and destruction of ETF shares -- can then bet that the recent rise or fall in the price of the assets underlying the ETF will be reversed. And make a lot of money. Under efficient markets theory, that’s not supposed to happen.

Now, the APs’ job is to equalize the price of the ETF and its assets, not to make sure the asset prices themselves reflect fundamentals. But the fact that they exist implies that there are at least some rational arbitrageurs in the market. And the fact that ETF asset prices have predictable reversals implies that rational arbitrageurs aren’t trying very hard to correct prices that are out of line with long-term fundamental values.

In other words, even markets with some rational participants can behave irrationally. Speculation can move prices around for irrational reasons, and rational traders often either can’t or won’t bother to correct them. However, it’s worth noting that the effect is less pronounced in 2012-2016 than in 2007-2011, suggesting the possibility that this particular market inefficiency may have been a temporary phenomenon. — Bloomberg"

PUNE: Bhaskar Gaikwad, the man whose FIR led to a litigation that eventually resulted in the Supreme Court’s directives on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, said on Monday that he would file a review petition against the “dilution” of the enactment.

“Certain facts in the FIR which formed the basis for the litigation were not brought to the notice of the apex court,” he told TOI. “The case took a different turn because a wrong translation of the original FIR was placed before the SC by the opponents,” he claimed.

Gaikwad, who is an employee of the College of Engineering in Pune, said, “The original FIR was in Marathi. When it was to be submitted to the Supreme Court, they submitted a version of the FIR which did not have the original three paragraphs which explained why the FIR was filed in the first place. Additionally, they added a line in the translated version which was misleading and led to the exoneration of the then state director of technical education (DTE), who had moved the Supreme Court.”

Gaikwad said he would file a review petition by next week based on the fact that a fraud has been committed by way of submission of wrong document in the court.

The case can be traced to 2009 when Gaikwad was posted at the Government College of Pharmacy in Karad. “The then principal had committed some fraud and wanted me to rewrite my records. I, being the store manager, refused to do so and even complained to the higher authorities that I was being pressured to do a wrong thing. This enraged the officials in the college and they wrote a bad review in my annual confidential report,” Gaikwad claimed.

He got a show-cause notice from the DTE’s regional office in Pune to which he replied satisfactorily owing to which the ACR about him was deleted for want of evidence.

“I filed an FIR against the two officials in the college. The DySP conducted an enquiry and sought permission from the DTE to prosecute these officials. But the DTE rejected the sanction and police filed a closure report in 2011. I never got any notice. Finally, I came to know about it in 2016,” Gaikwad said. He then filed a second complaint in 2016 against the two officials and the DTE.

The case went to the judicial magistrate first class in Karad after which the persons named in the FIR moved the Bombay high court. The HC rejected the plea to quash the FIR. Following this, the DTE moved the petition in the Supreme Court which eventually led to the judgment that has the entire Dalit population up in arms against the alleged “dilution” of the SC/ST Act (Prevention of Atrocities) Act."

And there are chanced that you are considering an investment in a notified equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) to save on tax outgo and accumulate wealth over time.

It is like killing two birds with one stone.

Among the 10 top performing ELSS schemes of last financial year, BOI AXA Tax Advantage Fund delivered over 30 per cent return to investors. On a long-term basis, the fund gave 12.68 per cent annualised return over three years and 20.09 per cent over five years.

Other ELSS funds that beat equity benchmark Sensex during the financial year ended March 31, 2018, included IDFC Tax Advantage Fund (up 24.89 per cent), Motilal Oswal Long Term Equity Fund (up 21.17 per cent), Taurus Tax Shield Fund (up 21.05 per cent) and Aditya Birla Sun Life Tax Relief 96 (up 20.96 per cent) and Aditya Birla Life Tax Saving Fund (up 20.81 per cent).

But do remember, past performance is no guarantee of future results in case of mutual funds. It is not advisable to select a scheme based on past performance alone.

Besides ELSS, PPF and NSC, other instruments that can help you save on tax outgo under Section 80C include premium paid for life insurance, Ulips, annuity plan, EPF, VPF, KVP, senior citizen's savings scheme (SCSS) 2004, five-year post office term deposits and five-year bank fixed deposits."

Edited excerpts:

Would you be a buyer in ICICI Bank NSE -0.49 % because good news and good prices rarely come together. Right now, the news is perceived to be bad and stock prices have come down.

This is a question which one would always fail to answer in accurate terms. On one side, the opportunity size is growing for the banking sector. There is no doubt on that aspect; on the other side, banks like ICICI, Axis have already proven themselves. But at the same time, balance has to be created in the approach for investment selection because the books are basically doubted at this point of time and should that be the situation, then may be some more pain left in this entire activity.

Whether one should wait for everything to come out is the question. Currently, the opportunity size is big enough and should try and look at relatively smarter and a cleaner banks. So, I am referring to names like Kotak and HDFC where the money would probably remain relatively safe, compared to the other two where the amount of assets are suspected. That is the reason for which I am paying premium for some of the assets.

We have put out some interesting data points and we have looked at the last five years and then 10 years. This is seriously long term. On a five-year basis, ICICI Bank has underperformed not only the Bank Nifty, it has also underperformed the Nifty. Why is that?

Probably, the aggressive approach that the bank has kept in its operation for a long period of time has resulted in a great amount of pain in the business for themselves. Earlier, an aggressive approach helped the banks in recovery of loans. Even the retail sector has struggled for a good period of time. Now, they are struggling from the corporate sector as far as the recovery aspect goes. As a result, the bank is languishing. The bank remains extremely aggressive in lending whereas I think they should be more judicious. There is nothing wrong with the businesses that the banks have created.

The management approach will have to be changed and things could fall into place eventually. We are not seeing that kind of a clear visibility on the management front for neither Axis nor ICICI. We believe that the opportunity would continue to remain strong with the likes of HDFC and Kotak where the management quality is far more superior and that is what I think the market is giving premium for.

Oil prices have tumbled overnight but steadying higher. Do you think that OMCs would come under pressure. Yesterday all the OMCs were down in expectation that they could not have the luxury or the liberty to actually pass on those price hikes to the end consumer especially in an election season?

There is a fear aspect on that front of passing on the hike in the prices to consumers. The more important point out here is that this government has successfully demonstrated the formula of removing the subsidy and some of the OMCs have benefitted out of it.

Right now, the valuation aspect is fully there in place which means that it is fully priced and most of the OMCs which are commodity-driven companies are not finding themselves new buyers or new investors in the market place. The high crude oil price has impact on the financials of the companies where the working capital related finance also gets stretched. Though, I expect the prices to get passed on, the working capital related finance would get stretched. That is the reason for which probably these stocks are not moving. I am not comfortable with the valuation per se and therefore, I would stay away from adding OMCs into the portfolio.

The new kids on the block – Bandhan Bank NSE -0.48 %, Sandhar Tech -- what do you make of them? Do you think that some of the new players given where valuations stand, could have a chance in an otherwise downtrending market?

Bandhan, in particular, is a good company, as far as business is concerned. The fact is this particular bank is valued at relatively stretched valuations and for the MFI business. I feel this valuation probably may not sustain. Given the quality that they have demonstrated, it may not come down easily, but a time correction is likely. That means for a longer period, they may not show enough appreciation post listing.

Sandhar Tech is undoubtedly a good company. But when you look at the other peers in the industry like Minda Corporation, the size of the business is probably much bigger. Valuation wise, Minda Corporation remains relatively inexpensive and it could be a better opportunity in this space. Therefore, instead of chasing the high valuation in some of the companies, probably one should go with the companies where valuation advantages are available for the near future."
849,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:20 AM IST",TNN,Software,Companies outsource crypto marketing to India,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 03, 2018)
Bengaluru: Many companies around the globe that are raising funds through cryptocurrencies are outsourcing their advertising and marketing to small — mainly Indian — agencies and groups. As these agencies use platforms like messaging app Telegram and those unique to the cryptoworld, the ban on cryptocurrency ads by Google and Facebook will have little impact on companies planning for initial coin offerings (ICOs).

“Two or three months ago, there were only a few platforms that helped in advertising. Now, a company going for an ICO will have a few 100 proposals from new marketing companies that are sprouting in India,” says Karnika Yashwant, CEO of Key Difference Media, a Chennai-based marketing agency that has worked with 14 foreign clients doing ICOs. Most of his clients were European.

ICOs became popular last year when nearly $3 billion was raised by startups globally through this method. An ICO is based on cryptocurrencies and is similar to an initial public offering (IPO), though it also has characteristics of crowdsourced funding.


Advertising is crucial for an ICO. The ads are mainly displayed in community groups in Telegram, cryptomedia websites — Cointelegraph, Coindesk, Live Bitcoin News, News BTC — and on websites that list ICO tokens — which are issued to investors in an ICO. “For a banner in a cryptomedia website, you’d have to dish out $10,000 a week,” he says.

Uday Kadirvel, co-founder of design-tech company Mobigraph, which is planning for an ICO in May, says the money is usually paid in cryptocurrencies or cash. The high rates globally have led to many companies outsourcing all their marketing services to India, where agencies do it for a far lesser price.

Most groups operate on Telegram, which is seen to be more secure than WhatsApp. The groups get a company’s tokens or cryptocoins in exchange for actions like sharing the company’s message to others.

This marketing technique is called an ‘airdrop’.

“Facebook and Google AdWords hardly generate demand (for ICOs). Only a person new to the space would be googling about it,” says Salim Ali, CEO of Loyakk, which is planning an ICO.

Ravi Kikan, COO of Panaesha Capital, says many may claim to be experts in the field, and it is important to verify the claims."

An intervention by NSA Ajit Doval and his counterpart Nasir Janjua helped India and Pakistan arrive at the March 30 rapprochement which has ended - for now - the standoff over harassment of diplomats and other staff.

Sources told TOI that a telephonic conversation between Doval and Janjua on March 26 finally sealed the agreement between the two countries that the matter be resolved under the 1992 Code of Conduct (CoC) for the treatment of diplomatic/ consular personnel in India and Pakistan.

Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria and his counterpart here Sohail Mahmood had worked hard in Islamabad and Delhi respectively with local authorities to arrive at the understanding that the CoC be revived to address issues related to diplomats and diplomatic premises.

Although few and far between, the engagements between the two NSAs have been the only form of any high-level contact between India and Pakistan in the past few years. The last substantive dialogue Doval and Janjua was in December 2017 in a meeting in Bangkok.

In the latest conversation, they also discussed the overall situation in bilateral ties and agreed to remain in touch.

While Doval strongly underlined India's position that the raid on an Indian residential complex under construction in Islamabad on February 15 was way outside the bounds of acceptable behaviour, Janjua asserted that this was the first time that even women and children of Pakistan diplomats were being harassed here.

India has also sought an assurance from Pakistan that it will not block the ongoing construction work in the Indian complex. Both India and Pakistan agreed that there was already a template in the form of the CoC which could be used for further negotiations over the issue.

The CoC upholds the ""dignity and personal inviolability"" of diplomatic/ consular personnel. It also clearly states that intrusive and aggressive surveillance and actions such as verbal and physical harassment, disconnecting of telephone lines, threatening telephone calls, pursuit in cars and unauthorised entry into residences shall not be resorted to.

For India, dialogue between the NSAs is important for addressing some of its key concerns over the issue of cross-border terrorism and also any flare up in Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan arrived at an understanding in 2016 that they were not going to make public any exchange between the NSAs. The only time they issued a joint press statement was after their meeting in Bangkok in 2015 in which Pakistan reintroduced the mention of J&K dispute. Earlier that year, then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif upset the Pakistan army by not specifically mentioning the J&K dispute in the joint statement issued after his meeting with PM Narendra Modi in Ufa."

This was a tweet from ace investor Vijay Kedia last November. This was a time when the domestic equity benchmarks were hitting new highs almost every day, IPOs were seeing multiple-time subscription and equity was the best asset class around.

Yet, Kedia was cautious. He advised investors to avoid leveraging and refrain from getting over-excited. He said back then that any stock can fall 10- 20 per cent or more without any warning.

This March, Kedia told ETMarkets.com that he was expecting the domestic equity market to correct for at least six months.

So, what made him think so?

It is a set pattern of investing, he told ETNow on Tuesday.

When a boom comes in real estate, the clerk who is working with the real estate agent actually becomes an agent. The real estate agent becomes an investor and the investor becomes a developer, he said.

Once they become developers, they are god. “Then the god who is sitting up there actually does not like that story. There, the downturn starts,” he said.

The same thing happens in the stock market. Brokers become investors, investors become consultants, consultants become fund managers and fund managers become God, Kedia said.

Is he a bear?

Certainly not. In fact, Kedia says he has been 100 per cent invested for the past 30 years of his investing career. “I cannot hold cash in my bank for more than five days, 10 days or may be a month,” he said.

It does not mean the market is going to fall further from here, says the ace investor.

It means don't leverage, don't get over excited. Keep a balanced mind. Always remember, any stock can fall 10- 20%… https://t.co/lFLDPMh8rw
— Vijay Kedia (@VijayKedia1) 1510548854000

“One thing that I did not like in the market was the euphoria. I felt the euphoria should die down. Does that mean stocks will go down 20-30 per cent? It depends from stock to stock. But the sentiment had gone so high that people had really become blind,” Kedia told ETNow.

If you tweet about a likely market fall and see people come to bite you, it means the time has come for the market to go down.

A host of stocks, especially smallcaps and midcaps have plunged between 20 per cent and 30 per cent from their January highs and investor sentiment has turned shaky.

Kedia was 100 per cent invested back then, and is so even now.

One should not worry about volatility, rather look at it as an opportunity to invest, he said recently.

He says he does not mind borrowing money to invest in stocks, provided the investment horizon is 15 -20 years. “But if it is for a short-term trade, you need to ask the astrologer or technical chartist,” he said."

857,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:24 AM IST",ET Bureau,Stocks,IBBI tightens rules for insolvency pros,"MUMBAI: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India has tightened the entry barriers for insolvency professionals by bringing in a new set of austere amendments with effect from April 1 which will ensure that only seasoned professionals are allowed to function.

With these measures, a bunch of 76 home-grown insolvency professional entities (IPEs), a kind of boutique firm, are now staring at a better prospect over their peers.

The amendment –– the IBBI (Insolvency Professionals) (Amendment) Regulation, 2018 ––has defined the role of insolvency professional entities (IPEs) and has also brought in stricter regulations for insolvency professionals.

According to the amendment, the sole objective of IPE is to provide support services to IPs, who are either partners or directors of IPE (not to others). The minimum of the IPEs must be Rs 1 crore while majority of share capital or partners’ capital must be held or contributed by partners or directors who are IPs. Majority of directors or partners are required to be insolvency professionals.

“Earlier, there were doubts on the role of IPEs, but now it is clear,” said Alok Dhir, partner at IRR Insolvency Professionals, one of the top IPEs. Pre-registration course is made mandatory before a professional is enrolled with IBBI as IP.

“These amendments are important and would provide level playing field to home-grown IPEs and only serious persons will take up this profession,” said Anil Goel, founder of AAA Insolvency Professionals, one of the first two IPEs, recognised by IBBI. “Also, the insolvency market is likely to see healthy competition among competent people, be it domestic or foreign players, who should own greater responsibilities in assignments,” he said. “The steps will cater to the demand side as NCLTs are not giving more than two or three cases to a single IP amid rising number of insolvency proceedings,” he said.

There were cases where individual IPs were blamed for poor performance and were removed by NCLT orders. Bankers blame it on knowledge deficit. “Bigger bankruptcy cases may be allotted to IPEs at a later stage.

The latest measures could be a prelude to that,” said Lekh Raj Bajaj, whole time director of A2Z Insolvency Services. Bajaj is now trying to raise Rs 1 crore before Sept end by adding more partners .

According to the amendment
Minimum net worth of the IPEs must be Rs 1 crore while majority of share capital or partners’ capital must be held or contributed by partners or directors who are IPs.

The Limited Insolvency Exam, which is required to be passed by professionals before getting enrolled with IBBI, now need to be passed within 12 months"

The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by IHS Markit, declined to 51 in March from 52.1 in February.

Since a reading above 50 indicates growth and one below it denotes contraction, March’s figure means manufacturing activity remained in expansion mode.

“India’s manufacturing sector continued to grow, albeit at the weakest pace since October, reflecting weaker gains in new business and a decline in employment for the first time in eight months,” said Aashna Dodhia, economist at IHS Markit and author of the report. “Indeed, amid a slower expected pace of recovery in consumer spending, IHS Markit marginally downgraded its real GDP forecast to 7.3% for fiscal year 2018-19.”

The data comes ahead of the monetary policy review this week, where the Reserve Bank of India is expected to hold rates. “PMI employment data gave warning signs in the labour market as jobs growth was not sustained in March,"" Dodhia said, adding that ""manufacturers operating in consumption and intermediate market groups signalled no appetite for recruitment"".

The overseas demand for Indian goods also slipped to a fourmonth low amid growing fears of a trade war between the US and China, which could have a domino effect across the globe. Advances in trade disputes could potentially weigh on sales to international clients, the survey said.

865,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:35 AM IST",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,Science,India vs China: How their space programmes are matching up,"(This story originally appeared in on Apr 02, 2018)
The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) had a setback this weekend with the space agency confirming it had lost contact with GSAT-6A, a mega communication satellite that was to provide mobile communications to both civilians and the armed forces. Despite the stumbling block, the space agency will continue with its upcoming launches although a massive quality assurance drive is likely to take place.

Meanwhile, China, too, is going full steam ahead. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, plans for the country's ""space dream"", as he calls it, have been put into overdrive. The country is looking to finally catch up with the United States and Russia after years of belatedly matching their space milestones.

For India, the failure to communicate with the GSAT-6a satellite is significant, however, the space agency hasn't given up all hope. Isro chairman, Dr K Sivan, said efforts are currently under way to establish contact with the satellite. Scientists said a power system malfunction rendered the satellite incommunicado. The cause of this ‘failure’ is still to be determined.

“We are hopeful, but as of now there is no contact with the satellite. If we are just able to speak with the satellite, we can get it back to working as there are several redundancy mechanisms including back-up power,” Isro's chief said.

How Isro lost contact
Four minutes after executing the second orbit-raising operation, Isro’s Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan lost all contact with GSAT-6A.

At 9.22am on Friday, the first orbit raising operation changed the apogee and perigee height to 36,412km and 5,054km, respectively. MCF gave the command to fire the LAM engine for the second orbit raising operation at 9.51am on Saturday. The satellite executed it and the engine fired for 53 minutes and 54 seconds. Soon after, it communicated back, the signals riding electromagnetic waves and covering a distance of 36,000km to reach the ground station within a fraction of a second. Then, all went blank.

Describing what transpired after the second orbit raising operations, the Isro chief said, “Everything went on as prescribed, a picture-perfect launch and two textbook orbit raising manoeuvres and then the satellite suddenly stopped communication. We are yet to determine what exactly went wrong.”

""After the successful launch of Gsat-6A from Sriharikota on Thursday, Isro was supposed to perform three orbit-raising manoeuvres to take the satellite from the launch orbit to the designated orbit (geo stationary orbit that is at the altitude of 36,000 km). The first manoeuvre was performed successfully on Thursday. The second orbit-raising exercise was performed on Saturday. As the Isro ground station was gearing up for the third manoeuvre, the communication link with the satellite snapped,"" Dr Sivan elaborated.

Orbit-raising means manoeuvring a satellite in space in stages in order to place it in its final orbit with the help of small thrusters.

K Sivan said Isro was trying to establish contact with the advanced communication satellite. “When there are power fluctuations, the satellite goes into a safe mode with all communication lost. This is not unusual.” “However, that has not happened this time,” Sivan told TOI, adding Isro was “still hopeful of regaining control.”

“If we are just able to speak with the satellite, we can get it back to working as there are several redundancy mechanisms including backup power. But everything hinges on reestablishing contact, ” Dr Sivan added.

Sivan said scientists were even trying to send non-command messages to see if the satellite responded. But the agency has not seen any success yet.

Second failure in seven months
Given that this is the second major technical issue faced by the agency — a PSLV heat shield separation failure prevented indigenous backup navigation satellite IRNSS-1H from reaching the orbit in August 2017— in seven months, there is expected to be a renewed emphasis on processes.

The mission to launch IRNSS-1H on board PSLV-C39 ended in failure in August last year after the satellite got stuck in the heat shield. The PSLV-C39 took the satellite to orbit but the heat shield tip or the rocket inside which the satellite is housed did not open. It was scheduled to open 3 minutes and 23 seconds into the flight of the rocket.

IRNSS-1H, the eighth in the NavIC constellation, was to replace IRNSS-1A, the first satellite in the constellation whose rubidium atomic clocks had stopped functioning. The clocks are a critical component in providing accurate locational data. The atomic clocks in IRNSS-1A stopped due to issues in critical factors like temperature, rubidium bulb that produce light and electronic power supply.

The navsat stuck in the heat shield, now declared space debris, is still roaming in the near-earth orbit and will ultimately fall on the earth.

India vs China: Lower costs may work in our favour
Notwithstanding these setbacks, India and China are challenging US and Russian dominance in exploration, the commercial space sector and in the use of space for military purposes.

The Modi government has been promoting the domestic space programme as a demonstration of India's low-cost technology and reliable launches. Last February, Isro launched 104 satellites in a single mission, most of them for foreign customers -- setting a record when it launched these satellites on a single rocket, only three of which were Indian. With lower costs for launches, India can thus get ahead of competition from the US and China.

And it's not just the lower costs, India is preferred for another reason as well. Owing to security concerns, China is often a less attractive option for private companies than India.

In this backdrop, the government is ramping up the country's space programme, which has a budget of around $4 billion, hoping it will improve the country's prospects of winning a larger share of the more than $300 billion global space industry.

And while India's space programme has made significant progress, the Chandrayaan-1 mission that was launched in 2008 and India's Mar mission Mangalyaan in 2013 are particularly key milestones in India's space history.

Lunar mission Chandrayaan-1, costing 3.86 billion rupees, was much cheaper than the spacecraft launched by Asian rival China, whose first lunar probe cost over $187 million when it launched in October 2007.

Mangalyaan which is currently orbiting Mars is another feather in the cap for Isro, making it only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia, to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mangalyaan mission readying it in just 15 months.

Isro’s upcoming launches
Meanwhile, the Isro chief has said the upcoming launches of navigation satellite IRNSS-1I and Chandrayaan-2mission will go ahead as per schedule. IRNSS-1I, likely to be launched in April, will replace the faulty first navsat IRNSS-1A, part of the Indian navigation system or NavIC or desi GPS. The three atomic clocks of the IRNSS-1A that were meant to provide precise location data had stopped working two years ago. Since the 2017 launch of navsat IRNSS-1H to replace the faulty satellite was unsuccessful, IRNSS-1I is, therefore, being launched to replace the first navsat. Currently, there are seven navsats in the orbit covering India and a region extending 1,500 km around it that provide real-time positioning and timing services.

Work is also on in full swing for the Chandrayaan-2 mission. Prior to the launch of the GSAT-6A satellite, the Isro chairman, referring to the lunar mission, remarked, “Preparations for the mission are in full swing. All the required tests are going on. The right time to launch the mission comes only once in a month. Therefore, we are hoping to launch it at the right time in April.”

He went on to add, “As Isro is launching such a complicated mission involving an orbiter, lander and a rover for the first time, we have to take extra precautions. If due to some glitch we are not able to launch in April, then we will try to launch the mission in October-November. If we launch the mission in between, we won’t get maximum benefit due to eclipses. To utilise the full lunar day (14 Earth days) for the moon exploration, the best time to launch the mission after April will be after October.”

According to recent reports, the launch will take place in the latter half of the year.

China’s space dream: How it began and where it is headed
While Isro is powering on with its upcoming launches, Beijing is continuing with ambitious plans for its space programme. The country has come a long way in its race to catch up with the United States and Russia, which have lost spacecraft, astronauts and cosmonauts over the decades. China's ""taikonauts"" have fared better and Beijing sees its military-run space programme as a marker of its rising global stature and growing technological might, according to an AFP report.

Key highlights of China's space story
* Soon after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, China Chairman Mao Zedong pronounced ""We too will make satellites.""

* However it took more than a decade - in 1970 - when China's first satellite lifted into space on the back of a Long March rocket.

* Human space flight took decades longer, with the first successful mission coming in 2003. The mission was successful with Yang orbiting the Earth 14 times during his 21-hour flight aboard the Shenzhou 5.

* Since then China has sent men and women into space with increasing regularity.

* Following in the footsteps of the US and Russia, China is striving to open a space station circling our planet.

* The Tiangong-1 was shot into orbit in September 2011. This space lab plunged back to Earth on April 1, 2018.

* In 2013, the second Chinese woman in space, Wang Yaping, gave a video class from inside the space module beamed back to children across the world's most populous country. The lab was also used for medical experiments and, most importantly, tests intended to prepare for the building of a space station.

* The lab was followed by the ""Jade Rabbit"" lunar rover in 2013 which looked at first like a dud when it turned dormant and stopped sending signals back to Earth. The rover made a dramatic recovery, though, ultimately surveying the moon's surface for 31 months, well beyond its expected lifespan.

* In 2016, China launched its second station, the Tiangong-2 lab into orbit 393 kilometres (244 miles) above Earth, in what analysts say will likely serve as a final building block before China launches a manned space station. Astronauts who have visited the station have run experiments on growing rice and thale cress and docking spacecraft.

* China plans to have a space station of its own, slated to begin assembling pieces in space in 2020 with manned use to start around 2022 -- China was deliberately left out of the International Space Station effort.

* China is also planning to build a base on the moon, the state-run Global Times said in early March, citing the Communist Party chief of the China Academy of Space Technology. The outpost will initially be controlled by artificial intelligence robots until humans are sent to occasionally manage it, the official said.

* But lunar work was dealt a setback last year when the Long March-5 Y2, a powerful heavy-lift rocket, failed to launch in July on a mission to send communication satellites into orbit. The failure forced the postponement of the launch of lunar probe Chang'e-5, originally scheduled to collect moon samples in the second half of 2017.

* The official Xinhua news agency quoted a China Lunar Exploration Programme designer as saying last week that the Chang'e 5 is now slated to land in 2019 and then bring back moon samples to Earth.

* Another robot, the Chang'e-4, is still due to land in 2018 for the ""first-ever soft landing and roving survey on the far side of the moon"", said Zuo Wei, deputy chief designer of the CLEP Ground Application System.

* China's astronauts and scientists have also talked up manned missions to Mars as it strives to become a ""global space power"". (Source: AFP)

What happened to China’s defunct space lab
China's defunct Tiangong 1 space station plunged back to Earth and mostly burned up on re-entry on Monday into the atmosphere over the central South Pacific, Chinese space authorities said.

The experimental space laboratory re-entered around 8:15 a.m. Beijing time, the China Manned Space Engineering Office said.Scientists monitoring the craft's disintegrating orbit had forecast the craft would mostly burn up and would pose only the slightest of risks to people. Analysis from the Beijing Aerospace Control Center showed it had mostly burned up.

Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at Australian National University, said Tiangong 1's re-entry was “mostly successful” and that it would have been better if the space station had not been spinning toward Earth, AP reported.

“It could have been better obviously, if it wasn't tumbling, but it landed in the Southern Pacific Ocean and that's kind of where you hope it would land,” Tucker said."

In New Delhi, petrol is selling at Rs 73.83 a litre, while one needs to shell out Rs 64.69 for a litre of diesel, its highest price ever. While this is surely bad news for motorists, it is a double whammy for the Centre, which is striving hard to get its fiscal math right.

For one, the ever-rising fuel prices is a political hot potato for the Modi government in the run-up to the 2019 polls, while it will also throw finance minister Arun Jaitley's Budget calculations out of the window. Not just that. The high diesel prices will also have a recoil effect on prices essential goods including vegetables and food grains.

There is already a growing clamour for cutting the excise duty on motor spirits, but the government has ruled out any such relief, saying that any rationalisation in the duty structure will take place only after petrol and diesel are brought under the GST net.

Experts see some merit in the call for a duty reduction, pointing out that between 2015-16 and 2016-17, excise collections from sale of auto fuels have risen over 35 per cent from Rs 1,78,591crore to Rs 2,42,691crore.

On ET NOW’s India Development Debate, top politicians and economists discussed the impact of the spike in fuel prices on consumers and the government’s finances. Here are some notable quotes:

PANEL VIEW

NARENDRA TANEJA
SPOKESPERSON, BJP

Fuel prices are uncomfortably high and we all are feeling the pinch. When Manmohan Singh decontrolled prices, we called it a historic reform. Companies were suffering under-recoveries. Today the picture is completely different. Our companies are debt-free. When prices are low, we used the incremental revenues on public infrastructure and developmental projects like the Ujjwala scheme. We need to rationalise taxes. We are in a hurry to bring petrol and diesel under GST.

SANJAY JHA
NATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, CONGRESS

It is the great Indian oil NSE -0.24 % robbery. The government has fleeced the common man of ?5 lakh in excise duties. When crude oil prices begin to fall, they charge you more. This is extortion; these are regressive taxes. No one should tinker with fuel price decontrol. Here you have a government which brazenly lied when the prices went down. They didn't pass on the benefits. They also misled the people on GST.

NR BHANUMURTHY
PROFESSOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC FINANCE & POLICY

Luck is fast running out for the government as far as international crude oil prices are concerned. The market believed there was a need for reforms. We don’t expect prices to go up by beyond $70/barrel. The government still has a role; they can reduce the excise duty. There will be some pressure on fiscal deficit; it is a trade-off between inflation and fiscal deficit. We should not go back to fuel subsidies. Overall the high fuel prices will have a significant impact on interest rates."
868,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:44 AM IST",ET Bureau,Miscellaneous,Freagles find their way to forever parents in Bengaluru,"Bengaluru: When Deepti James got Cleopatra home in July last year, the seven-year-old beagle settled into a nook of her Mahadevapura apartment and did not move for about three weeks. Cleo, rescued from a pharmaceutical laboratory, had been subjected to traumatic drug tests. “She had scars on her back and her ribs, and both she and her pups had been used for breeding. Cleo did not know how to adapt to the world — everything, from the stairs to the sky, was new to her. She was flustered by visitors, and the slightest sound,” said James. James and her husband were shortlisted after a stringent adoption process and undertook pre-adoption counselling session. Their home had to be prepared for the dogs: meshes on the grills, customised toys, name tags and Martingale collars. James said, “When we tried to take her out for walks, Cleo would just sit down and we’d have to pick her up and walk.”

Two years ago, Bengaluru witnessed the largest lab release of in the world when 156 ‘freagles’ (free beagles) were rehabilitated by Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (Cupa). Since then, Freagles of India, a non-profit formed by Cupa volunteers, has re-homed over 125 beagles across India. They have recently rescued a batch of 13 beagles from a Hyderabad lab, which will be up for adoption soon.

Beagles are used for clinical testing in pharmaceutical and pesticide industries. According to a paper titled Use of Animals in Scientific Research, published by the Indian Council of Medical Research in 2000, “Toxicological studies, especially those performed on rodents and beagle dogs are the essential link between the pre-clinical phase and clinical development of the drug molecule.” In 2015, the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) mandated that beagles must be rehabilitated after three years. Rescued animals usually take time to adapt to the outside world.

According to , founder trustee, Freagles of India, Bengaluru leads when it comes to people opening up their homes to lab-tested beagles, followed by Pune and Ahmedabad. The reasons, she says, is the example set by a few families and increased awareness. “Majority of the families opting to adopt are first-timers, which is good, since they do not have pre-set notions and are willing to learn,” said Gopinath. “Counselling is also critically focused on setting the right expectations.”

According to strategy consultant Rashmi Gowda, a first-time adopter, online platforms like Beagle Brigade, with over 8,800 members who have adopted lab-rescued beagles, offers a strong support network. “Rescued beagles need a lot of mental stimulation, physical exercises and specialised care. All it takes is patience and understanding.”"

871,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 11:52 AM IST",ET Bureau,Miscellaneous,Students make device to rescue children trapped in borewells,"Bengaluru: In a city, where water needs of all its residents are not met through piped water, borewells are a go-to solution for many. Bengaluru has a few lakh borewells, and many of them fail after digging with no water. The failed ones, if left uncovered, can turn into death traps for unsuspecting children, who can easily fall into these deep holes that vary in width from 8 to 10 inches.

It was this problem and past instances of children trapped into borewells that prodded final semester students of PES Polytechnic Raghothama P, Achutha R, Adithya P, Ashray Aksh, Pavan Kumar, Tejas R, and Amith Gowda to come up with Borot, a robotised-saving device for accidents that happen in unguarded borewells. “The device works on the principle of rack and pinion mechanism. It can be controlled by Android devices and can work on normal electricity and sealed acid batteries,” said Raghothama, 18.

Borot is fitted with a spy strike miniature camera on a robotic arm, which can slide down inside a bore and send live videos to a screen. With its sensors, it can analyse poisonous gas detection, motion of a child who may have fallen into one. “If a child is alive, the device will set off an air balloon through a separate chord. This will go beneath the child and inflate, to arrest further sinking,” he adds.

Borewells, are usually dug in the range of 200 to 1,600 feet in Bengaluru. If a child falls into one, the survival rate is only 1%, according to Bhustalimath BM, a freelance ground water consultant. “When a child falls into a borewell, the reaction time is most crucial. For every 100 feet, the temperature rises by a degree, inside the earth’s crust. This combined with gases like methane make survival extremely difficult,” he said.

Though the government by law has made it mandatory for unused, abandoned or failed borewells to be covered, in rural areas, many are still left open due to negligence. Currently, if a child falls into a borewell, rescues operations are primarily manual, where a camera is sent into the hole to gauge the situation. Then depending how deep a child has fallen, either a person is sent in, to retrieve or a parallel bore is dug, from where another horizontal bore is dug. Rescue operations must be fast and precise with the best of geophysical instruments. “But in south India where the soil is rocky, it is not easy to estimate the size of a rock that blocks access. Moreover, intensive drilling can make the rock collapse on the child, or even the entire borewell,” points out Bhustalimath.

Borot, which was displayed at the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum in Bengaluru took 45 days to make from the day the idea was born. However, currently, it’s only a prototype or concept and needs to be tested in real-life situations, to understand its full usability. “The model is scalable. However, the capacity of the device has to be increased in terms of power, weight lifting and more sensors can be added to make it fool proof,” says Priyanka C, a mechanical engineering teacher at PES Polytechnic, who mentored the team of Borot."

In February, the senior BJP leader had addressed a public gathering at Holalakere.

Against the backdrop of Karnataka government according religious minority tag to Lingayats ahead of the assembly polls, BJP as well the Congress launched an extensive drive to woo the Lingayats, who are numerically and politically strong in Karnataka.

Gandhi's meeting with Shivakumar Swamiji is aimed at strengthening his party's base among Lingayats.

In the debt space there are 16 new categories under which the fund houses will be aligning their existing and new schemes. This move by the regulator is intended to bring uniformity in the practice of categorizing schemes across mutual funds.

Several mutual fund houses have started changing the attributes of their schemes, while others are merging schemes to comply by the new regulations. Sebi released its order to standardize the scheme categories and characteristics of each category in October, 2017.

Here are the new debt categories and what kind of assets they will invest:

Overnight funds: These open-ended debt schemes will invest in overnight securities. Investment in overnight securities with a maturity of one day.

Liquid funds: These schemes will invest in debt and money market securities with a maturity of up to 91 days.

Ultra short duration funds: These open ended ultra-short term debt schemes will invest in instruments with a maturity between three months and six months.

Low duration fund: These open-ended debt schemes will invest in instruments with a duration between six months and 12 months.

877,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 12:02 PM IST",,Analysis,Rajat Jain on where to look for comfort in a volatile market,"In an interview with ET Now, Rajat Jain, CIO, Principal PNB AMC, says he is keeping his portfolio unchanged this quarter and that well-run large PSU banks are as good as private sector counterparts.

Edited excerpts:

With RBI allowing banks to spread their bond trading losses over four quarters, things optically are going to look a little better. Is it time to buy PSU banks?

There are two or three points there. First, the RBI circular allows the banks to spread bond trading losses in Q3 and Q4 over four quarters. The larger banks had already made provision for that. So, potentially, that may reverse. In some ways, it is going to help them but they will have to create investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) -- 2% of HFT (Held for Trading) and MTM (Mark-to-Market). This is actually tier II capital and so it is not as straight forward but yes it does have some help.

On the PSU banks, the issue is that the larger PSU banks are as well run as anybody else. In our portfolio, for example we do have a large PSU banks but these banks are challenged in terms of capital, manpower and technology, It is not really PSU versus non-PSU, it is more better-run banks versus the not-so-well run banks. We like the larger PSU banks.

In IT, we have seen outperformance and resilience in February and March. Do you expect healthier performance from some of the midcap names?

There will be cross currency tailwinds of about 150 to 200 bps. Overall, we are expecting a quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.5 to 3% Q-o-Q constant currency.

Midcap ITs have done well. Some of the arbitrage in case of midcap ITs are slightly more expensive than the large cap IT names. In next one and a half to two odd years, we expect earnings to grow on an yearly basis compounded about 8% to 10% per annum. This is the kind of guidance we expect companies to give.

In our portfolios, we were underweight IT for a fairly long time but in the last two to three quarters we have cut our underweight position substantially.

Does one need to be slightly more careful about buying private banks now?

We have diversified our portfolio in financial space. There are NBFCs, the so called corporate facing banks and the retail facing banks. The retail facing banks account for 50-55% and the rest would be between NBFCs and corporate facing banks.

The corporate facing banks include the large private sector banks and the large PSU banks which think are as well run as any private sector banks. These banks have faced challenges because of exposure to infrastructure, lending over the last four-six years. But other than that, the large PSU banks are as well run as anybody else.

One space that we have been slightly more cautious about is the NBFCs. We do have NBFCs in our portfolios but valuation-wise, they are expensive. Lots of NBFCs have raised money, capital and the capacity has increased in the sector as it were and there is increased competition plus cost of borrowing is going up. This is one space we are slightly cautious about.

Some of the so called brand companies are trading high right now. Nestle NSE 0.41 % is at a 52-week high, Britannia is at 5100. Titan touched a 52-week high last week. Why are these stocks trading at such lofted PE multiples?

Our view is probably market is fishing for certainty. In the last quarter or two, as markets turned volatility, tendency has been to reward companies with certainty of earnings. We have a space where rural consumption is good, urban consumption is also holding up reasonably and even though the valuations are not cheap, we expect 15% or 20% sort of earnings growth for the next few years.

I am not saying I agree with that approach but that is where the market is sort of fishing.

What about two-wheelers?

That is the point I was making. Rural consumption is clearly holding up. Two-wheeler makers are well run, reasonably valued companies. They actually should do well and which is why we have some of them in our portfolio.

There has been a selloff in mid and small cap stocks, large cap stocks also have corrected. Any place where you want to be a contra buyer?

Our portfolio is positioned long on the domestic story. So, we are long on autos, including two-wheelers, four-wheelers, auto ancillaries and cement. We have cut underweight in the IT space.

I think near term probably large caps will still do well when there is an environment of flight to safety which is why you see these consumer stocks trading the way they are.

But over the next two to three years, mid-caps still should do better than large caps. And we find them reasonably well-run companies available at not so crazy valuations. So, we have added some of those to our portfolio as well. We really have not made any wholesale changes to our portfolio. We remain positioned the way we were in the last quarter.

There is talk about OMCs margins coming under pressure because of a political overhang. Your view.

In the OMC and the broad energy space, we have select oil marketing companies. But overall, we did cut down our exposure simply because we did see oil prices rise and we had them for a while. We have played the story. So, we are not so interested in that space at this point of time. We like the gas space and we have been in that space but OMC is actually something that we have cut our exposure to."

That is the point I was making. Rural consumption is clearly holding up. Two-wheeler makers are well run, reasonably valued companies. They actually should do well and which is why we have some of them in our portfolio.

There has been a selloff in mid and small cap stocks, large cap stocks also have corrected. Any place where you want to be a contra buyer?

Our portfolio is positioned long on the domestic story. So, we are long on autos, including two-wheelers, four-wheelers, auto ancillaries and cement. We have cut underweight in the IT space.

I think near term probably large caps will still do well when there is an environment of flight to safety which is why you see these consumer stocks trading the way they are.

But over the next two to three years, mid-caps still should do better than large caps. And we find them reasonably well-run companies available at not so crazy valuations. So, we have added some of those to our portfolio as well. We really have not made any wholesale changes to our portfolio. We remain positioned the way we were in the last quarter.

There is talk about OMCs margins coming under pressure because of a political overhang. Your view.

In the OMC and the broad energy space, we have select oil marketing companies. But overall, we did cut down our exposure simply because we did see oil prices rise and we had them for a while. We have played the story. So, we are not so interested in that space at this point of time. We like the gas space and we have been in that space but OMC is actually something that we have cut our exposure to."

880,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 01:02 PM IST",ETMarkets.com,Stocks,Jio hit! Airtel looks set to report first quarterly loss in over 15 years,"Intense competition triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio may pull the bottomline of telecom major Bharti Airtel into the red in March quarter.

Should that happen, it will be the first time since 2002 that the firm led by billionaire entrepreneur Sunil Bharti Mittal will report a quarterly loss.

The company has been seeing a steady drop in net profit in last four consecutive quarters.

Brokerage Kotak Securities projects Airtel to report a consolidated net loss of Rs 380 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

The company had last reported a net loss of Rs 7.07 crore in the third quarter of FY03, according to data available with corporate database Capitaline.

The brokerage projected India wireless revenues and Ebitda of Bharti Airtel at Rs 10,140 crore (down 5.7 per cent QoQ and 22 per cent YoY) and Rs 3,000 crore (down 15 per cent QoQ, down 37 per cent YoY), respectively.

Even on a consolidated basis, the forecast for the quarter is weak. “We expect a 10 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and 15 per cent year-on-year (YoY) drop in consolidated Ebitda at Rs 6,700 crore despite healthy trends for Africa operations,” Kotak said in a report.

The brokerage said the Airtel’s home broadband segment is already feeling the impact of Jio’s imminent commercial launch, while DTH business grappled with an increase in content cost during Q4.

Bharti Airtel posted 16 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in consolidated profit (reported profit after tax) at Rs 560.70 crore in Q3FY18 over Rs 671.50 crore in Q3FY17.

In the previous three sequential quarters, profits fell 64 per cent, 58 per cent and 69 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. Only during December quarter of 2016, the company has reported a 65 per cent YoY rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,108.10 crore.

Profit attributable to shareholders dipped 39 per cent YoY to Rs 305.80 in Q3FY18.

Jio is trying to squeeze all the players in the . The new-entrant is getting into content production as well as in the telecom infrastructure space. They own a lot of the parts of the ecosystem. Bharti Airtel has been the only player that has the financial depth to fight, and perhaps, even the Vodafone-Idea combine. It is going to be a three-player market, which is very interesting. However, this is not a great time to be a shareholder, said Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind to ET Now.

of Bharti Airtel have been doing well, though. The stock managed to outpace other telecom players as well as BSE Sensex in returns in last one year. The scrip jumped over 15 per cent between April 3 last year and April 2 this year, whereas Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications slipped 8.65 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, during the same period.

On the other hand, BSE Sensex rose 11 per cent.

Jio’s pricing strategy unveiled in January 2018 impacted international termination rate (ITR) cut from February 1, 2018, while the downtrend in Arpu (average revenue per user) continued, which are likely to reflect in the top line, leading to another quarter of sharp sequential drop in revenue for the incumbents, market experts said.

Idea Cellular has already been reporting losses for last five consecutive quarters. It reported a net loss of Rs 1,284.50 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 against a net loss of Rs 383 crore reported for the year-ago quarter.

The Birla firm had posted a consolidated net losses of Rs 1,106.60 crore, Rs 814.90 crore and Rs 327.70 crore, respectively, for Q2FY18, Q1FY18 and Q4FY17, respectively.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal maintained ‘Buy’ on both Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular but cut target prices. “Our target price is now Rs 581 (as against Rs 680 earlier) for Airtel and Rs 91 (Rs 120 earlier) for Idea,” the brokerage house said in a report.

“Since January 2018, telecom service providers have once again turned to market share gains at the cost of profitability. The sector might continue to see aggressive pricing for the next 12 months. We cut our FY20 India wireless EBITDA estimates by 12 per cent for Bharti Airtel and by 9 per cent for Idea,” Motilal Oswal said."

A majority of 35 BSE500-listed companies that hit record highs in last one month are ruling at trailing PE multiples of anywhere between 40 and 230, which suggests investors still prefer growth to value.

Among these stocks, Domino's Pizza operator Jubilant Foodsworks hit an all-time high of Rs 2,396 on March 27, trading at 230 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share.

Radhakishan Damani's Avenue Supermarts hit its record high exactly a month ago to rule at 177.7 times trailing price multiples.

Kishore Biyani's Future Lifestyle and Tata Group's Titan Company are a few other examples of growth stocks that have hit all-time highs in last one month.

In the broader market, six of every 10 BSE500 stocks traded at least 20 per cent below their all-time high levels.

""In last one quarter or two, the market has been in mood to reward companies with certainty of earnings. It is not looking at companies where earnings could be iffy or where there is speculation about whether the numbers will be good. We certainly think rural consumption is going good. Urban consumption is also reasonably holding up, even though valuations are not cheap. We expect 15-20 per cent earnings growth,"" Rajat Jain, CIO, Principal PNB AMC, told ETNow on Tuesday.

Jain does not agree with the growth-only approach, through he agrees this is where the market is tilted.

Jubilant Foodworks has reported strong same-store sales growth, led by high volumes and 6-7 per cent price hikes after rollout. The company has seen strong consumer response to its new offer (Everyday Value) and pizza upgrade, HDFC Securities said in a note.

Edelweiss Securities expects Avenue Supermarts to report revenue, Ebitda and PAT growth of 25.5 per cent, 31.8 per cent and 41.2 per cent, respectively, over FY17-20.

Titan joined the elite Nifty50 club on Tuesday.

""High quality stocks will keep making new highs. But stocks which are making lifetime highs, let’s say D-Mart or Jubilant Life or Titan, are extremely expensive companies. They are trading in multiples of 70-80 and yet they are making new highs,” said Amit Jeswani, CIO at Stallion Asset.

""It is clearly showing that the trend is towards high quality stocks and 2018 will be about chasing quality, and not low-quality stocks,"" Jeswani said.

Data showed stocks like Nestle India, Astral Poly, Bajaj Electrical, Bharat Forge, V-Mart Retail,

Endurance Tech, and Lakshmi Mach Works, among others, have hit record highs this month.

None of these stocks have PE values lower than 40. Equity benchmark BSE currently trades at 22.93 times its 12-month EPS.
""Low-quality stocks are now a part of everyone’s portfolio. These stocks are not going to rally. It is going to be a move towards high growth, high , free cash flow and very high quality stocks,” Jeswani told ET Now.

High PE multiple of a growth stock is supported by expectations that a company may continue to deliver above-average earnings. When bond yields fall, it generally makes equity investment look attractive and leads to re-rating of growth stocks.

Experts note that growth stocks are not immune to market corrections.

Kotak Securities said were the macro factors to worsen, growth stocks may also correct. “Their high valuations are unlikely to sustain in a scenario of higher domestic and global bond yields and increased earnings (weaker economic growth), macro and political uncertainty,” it said."
889,"Last Updated: Apr 04, 2018, 05:52 PM IST",ET CONTRIBUTORS,Stocks,A new way of recording revenue comes into force: Will it hurt?,"By Sumit Seth

Ind AS compliant entities will have to now adopt the new Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with Customers, from April 1, 2018. Revenue being the most important financial metric used by both preparers and investors to measure or evaluate an entity’s historical financial performance, future growth prospects, and financial condition, this standard is expected to impact mostly all companies.

Some of the key areas of changes include:

Transfer of control model
Under Ind AS 115, revenue will be recognised when a customer obtains “control” of a good or service, while under current GAAP, revenue is recognised when there is a transfer of risk and rewards. A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or service.

Transfer of control is neither same as transfer of risks and rewards nor similar to the culmination of an earnings process as understood today. Entities will be required to apply the new guidance to determine whether revenue should be recognized ‘over time’ or ‘at a point in time’. As a first step, a company will have to first determine whether control is transferred over time. If the answer to this question is negative, only then revenue will be recognized at a point in time, or else it will be recognized over time. This could significantly change the timing of revenue recognition compared to current GAAP for certain businesses.

Performance obligation
Understanding what a customer expects to receive as a final product is necessary to assess whether goods or services should be combined and accounted as a single performance obligation or separate elements. Some contracts contain a promise to deliver multiple goods or services, but the customer is not purchasing individual items, but the final good or service which is the aggregate of those individual items.

Under Ind AS 115, companies will have to necessarily determine whether there are multiple promises in a contract and whether those promises are distinct – these promises may be may be explicit or implicit including based on past customary business practices .

The consideration will then be allocated to multiple components and revenue recognized when those distinct goods or services are delivered, i.e. when control is transferred. In my experience, this area can be quite complex and could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition – for example if certain elements do not meet the definition of a distinct performance obligation, then revenue will need to be deferred until the control over the combined items is delivered.

Variable consideration
Entities may agree to provide goods or services for consideration that varies upon certain future events which may or may not occur. Examples include volume and cash discounts, refund rights, rebates, performance bonuses/incentives, penalties, right of returns, free goods or services etc., which will all be an adjustment to revenue under Ind AS 115.

Variable consideration is a wide term and includes both negative and positive adjustments to the revenue. Estimating upward adjustments to revenue, is something we are not used to, and this could result in earlier recognition of revenue as compared to current practice.

Licensing
Another area of change involves intellectual property (IP) licensing. Entities will need to determine whether the licence transfers to the customer ‘over time’ or ‘at a point in time’. A licence that is transferred over time allows a customer access to the entity’s IP as it exists throughout the licence period – such revenue is recognised over time. Licence provides right to access IP if all of the following criteria are met: 1) The licensor performs activities that significantly affect the IP; 2) The rights expose the customer to the effects of these activities; and 3) The activities are not a separate good or service.

Examples of such arrangements include consumer franchise arrangements, popular consumer brands, tradenames, etc. On the other hand, licences transferred at a point in time allow the customer the right to use the entity’s IP as it exists when the license is granted. The customer must be able to direct the use and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the licensed IP to recognise revenue when the license is granted. Such examples include licensing of product formula, IT software, patents, etc.

Others
Contracts that provide the customer or the entity with a significant financing benefit (explicitly or implicitly) i.e. in the form of advance or deferred payments will require the entity to adjust revenue for the time value of money. This may impact entities which have significant advance or deferred payment arrangements e.g. real estate infrastructure, EPC etc.

Further, entities sometimes incur costs (such as sales commissions or mobilisation activities) to obtain or fulfil a customer contract. Contract costs that meet certain criteria will be now capitalised as an asset and get amortized as revenue is recognised.

Presentation and disclosures
Finally, extensive disclosures are required under Ind AS 115 to provide greater insight into both, revenue recognized and expected to be recognized in the future from existing customer contracts, including reconciliations of contract assets and liabilities balances.

Additionally, companies will have to provide disaggregated revenue information e.g. by product lines, services, geographies, type of contract fixed price or time and material, taking into account information reported internally to the chief operating decision maker for evaluating performance and externally in earnings release, investor presentations etc.

Way ahead!
The new standard can result in increases or decreases of previously reported revenues depending on the company’s business practices, contract terms and existing accounting policies. Beyond accounting change, companies will have to closely analyse their business practices within the revenue cycle, including other organizational implications such as IT systems, processes & controls, taxes, etc.

""Efforts are on to establish the communication link with the satellite,"" an official from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told IANS here.

On Sunday, ISRO admitted that it lost the crucial link with GSAT-6A, two days after it was launched on board the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) from its spaceport in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh, 80 km northeast of Chennai.

The satellite was to be placed in its intended orbit 36,000 km above ground level after three orbit-raising manoeuvres from the space agency's Master Control Facility (MCF) at Hassan in Karnataka, about 180 km from Bengaluru.

The communication teams at the MCF are hopeful to restore the link when the 2,000 kg satellite will be closer to them by hovering over India on Tuesday, as it orbits around the earth above 36,000 km away for every 20 hours a day.

Former ISRO Chairman K. Kasturirangan believes that each glitch in the space field is dynamic and could not be predicted.

""Nothing is common when it comes to space and each glitch is dynamic and contemporary,"" he told IANS.

ISRO Chairman K. Sivan earlier told IANS that the data available with the space agency shows that the satellite was ""alive"" and that restoring the communication link was possible.

""We are going through the data meticulously to establish a link with the satellite,"" Sivan had said.

Sivan, however, asserted that the efforts to connect with the satellite would not affect or delay other ISRO's projects in any way.

With a life span of 10 years, the satellite, worth over Rs 240 crore, was meant to provide a platform for developing technologies that could be useful in satellite based mobile communication applications.

Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has found himself with few defenders in the technology industry.

Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk and Salesforce.com Inc.’s Marc Benioff have criticized the social media network in the wake of its user data scandal involving political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica. Other tech leaders have remained quiet in the ensuing backlash against Facebook, in contrast to Silicon Valley’s usual practice of rallying around its own during major crises.

Facebook has sought to repair its public image and trust with more than 2 billion users after reports surfaced that Cambridge Analytica obtained data on as many 50 million of those U.S. accounts. As Zuckerberg, 33, faces calls to testify before Congress and lawmakers raise the idea of new regulations on tech, his peers have either stayed quiet or publicly criticized his company. In times of crisis, tech companies have sometimes huddled together to defend the industry, such as when Apple fought the FBI to protect an encrypted iPhone and during President Donald Trump’s proposed immigration ban last year against mostly Muslim countries.

“Protecting privacy is good for business now,” said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that advocates for digital privacy. “Users are looking for other big tech personalities like Tim Cook, like Elon Musk, to be reassured that they’re not doing what Facebook did.”

When Apple was fighting an FBI attempt to get into an encrypted iPhone, Facebook joined Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and other large tech firms to support Cook’s stance. Still, Apple executives, including Steve Jobs, have criticized internet companies’ advertising business models in the past.

Cook was asked about Facebook’s privacy crisis last month and called for stronger regulation of user data. Then, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC, Cook said he “wouldn’t be in this situation” if he were in Zuckerberg’s shoes. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple’s profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Zuckerberg responded in an interview with Vox, published Monday: “I find that argument — that if you’re not paying, that somehow we can’t care about you — to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.”

“There are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay” for a service and that having an “advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people,” Zuckerberg said. “If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.”

Facebook’s shares have dropped 16 percent in the past two weeks since the Cambridge Analytica issue surfaced.

The criticism from others in the industry may reveal a division in attitudes between social media and other types of tech companies that don’t rely on personal data for advertising businesses.

“In a normal state, I wouldn’t expect Tim Cook to be a natural defender of Facebook’s interests,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Evercore ISI.

Since social media companies have to leverage user data in order to better sell to advertisers, it becomes harder for them to promise strong privacy while retaining a robust business model.

Gebhart said that privacy is increasingly a selling point for technology users, but for social media companies, data abuses are a feature, not a bug.

“This is about the entire web surveillance-based and advertising-powered business model,” she said. “Facebook is just the worst or best at it, depending on your view of surveillance.”

Even social media company Snap Inc. seemed to be poking fun at Facebook’s woes. For April Fools’ Day, the Snapchat app rolled out a satirical filter with fake Cyrillic that mimicked Facebook’s user interface. The bottom of the image said it was liked by “your mom, a bot and 2 others.” Some on Twitter interpreted the gag filter as a reference to Facebook’s troubles with Russian meddling on its website.

While WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton joined the #deleteFacebook bandwagon, Gebhart said other social media networks such as Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn have mostly stayed quiet during the firestorm against their rival.

Salesforce’s Benioff, in contrast, has been vocal for months on the need for Facebook to be regulated like tobacco, and reiterated that view last month at a company conference.

“I got in trouble with friends of mine at Facebook, who were calling me and very upset with me because I said, ‘Facebook is the new cigarettes,”’ Benioff said. “It’s addictive, it’s not good for you and there’s outside forces trying to manipulate you to use it.”

Musk deleted the Facebook pages for his companies, Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., after a Twitter user asked him to last month.

Musk later said he wasn’t making a political statement, nor did he have the sites taken down because of pressure from Twitter users.

“Just don’t like Facebook,” he wrote. “Gives me the willies. Sorry.”"
895,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 12:53 PM IST",PTI,Politics,Stubble burning doubles Delhi pollution: Harvard study,"Agricultural fires are to blame for about half of the pollution experienced in Delhi in October and November, a peak stubble burning season in Punjab, a Harvard study has found using satellite data from NASA.

Many farmers in northwest India typically burn abundant crop residue on the fields after harvest season, to prepare their fields for subsequent planting.

To what extent the large quantity of smoke emitted by these fires contributes to the already severe pollution in New Delhi has remained a key question.

For the past few years, every autumn New Delhi - already plagued with thick pollution - gets engulfed choking smoke likened by many to a gas chamber.

While crop burning has been illegal for years, there has not been a large enough deterrent to effectively crack down on the practice, in part because it's been difficult to measure exactly how much smoke from the fires is making it downwind to the city.

Researchers from the Harvard University and NASA have now shown that in October and November, a peak burning season in Punjab, about half of all pollution in Delhi can be attributed to agricultural fires on some days.

""On certain days during peak fire season, air pollution in Delhi is about 20 times higher than the threshold for safe air as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO),"" said Daniel H Cusworth, a graduate student at SEAS and

To model how much of that pollution is coming from the fires, the study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, used satellite data from NASA to identify hotspots corresponding to active fires.

The team gathered available data for October and November, 2012 to 2016 and plugged it into a particle dispersion model - an algorithm that accounts for geography, wind patterns, and physics to predict how far and in what direction smoke particles travel.

During the post-monsoon season, the air in northern India is particularly stagnant, meaning smoke particles do not vent into the atmosphere as they would during other times of the year.

Instead, the black carbon and organic particulate matter slowly permeates throughout the entire region, which is home to 46 million people.

In urban areas, that smoke mixes with existing pollution from cars and factories creating a thick, deadly haze.

On average, without fires, urban Delhi experiences about 150 microgrammes per cubic metre of fine particulate air pollution.

To put that into perspective, the WHO puts the threshold for safe air at 25 microgrammes per cubic metre, and India's Central Pollution Control Board limits exposure to 60 microgrammes per cubic metre, said Cusworth.

Extreme fires during the post-monsoon season can pump on average about 150 microgrammes per cubic metre of fine particulate matter into the city, doubling the amount of pollution and increasing total levels 12 times higher than WHO recommendations, and even 20 times higher on some days."

The Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA) has submitted its appeal to various ministries such as the prime minister's office, health and family welfare, agriculture, commerce and industry, and labour.

In a press release issued on Tuesday, FAIFA said an erroneous research paper was recently published by an organisation backed by multinational tobacco companies which had downplayed the volume of smuggled cigarettes in the country.

Murali Babu, general secretary at FAIFA, said this clearly demonstrates some of the multinational companies’ are using all possible means to mislead policy makers and pushing for a policy that makes their business more profitable, be it through excessive regulations, high tax arbitrage or downplaying the problem of smuggled cigarettes.

""This is being done to divert the attention of the government agencies, who are tracking and seizing smuggled cigarettes,"" he said.

The organisation said tobacco farmers in India are under extreme duress due to heavy taxation and adverse regulatory environment on the legal cigarette industry. The excessive taxation on cigarettes has given a huge boost to smuggled cigarettes in India which currently stands at 25 billion sticks, it said.

Smuggled cigarettes do not use Indian tobacco and because of this Indian farmers have lost volume of 16 million kg per annum due to loss of volume of legal cigarette industry. This has resulted in drop in earnings of FCV tobacco farmers which has shrunk cumulatively by more than Rs 3,650 crore in the last three years, FAIFA said."

Government banks were staring at a potential mark-to-market loss of 200 billion rupees ($3 billion) in the March quarter, three times more than in the period to December, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG report last month. Hit by the erosion, lenders have remained on the sidelines, contributing to the deepest rout in two decades in the nation’s sovereign bonds.

“The recent set of news are positive for the market and suggest that the authorities are getting proactive in their approach,” said Vivek Rajpal, a rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore. The rout was “largely a supply-demand issue. This balance is getting resolved slowly and this should push yields lower with time.”

The reprieve came days after the government surprised traders by reducing the fiscal first-half borrowing, a move that spurred the first monthly advance since July. With the reduction in debt supply, traders have been calling on the government to do more to spur demand.

Spike Guard
The benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped as much as nine basis points, and was trading five basis points lower at 7.35 per cent at 10:40 a.m. in Mumbai. The rupee strengthened 0.2 per cent to 65.0575 per dollar, halting a two-day drop, while bank stocks advanced.

There is a precedent for the central bank’s action. The RBI in 2013 allowed banks to spread their bond-trading losses as the benchmark yield surpassed 9 percent and the rupee fell to a record amid the taper tantrum selloff. This time, the authority has also asked lenders to set up a so-called Investment Fluctuation Reserve to guard against yield spikes in the future.

Three other factors are driving the shift in sentiment:

Sovereign debt worth 700 billion rupees mature in April. The cash returned would be the most in a single month for the new fiscal year, according to central bank data The RBI may sound less hawkish at its policy review this week as it holds the key policy rate at 6 per cent, according to all 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg The RBI is also mulling a higher quota for foreigners, which is currently capped at 5 per cent of the total outstanding. Every single percentage point increase may lure as much as 850 billion rupees of inflow, according to DBS Bank Ltd
Yield on the 10-year bonds slid 33 basis points in March to end at 7.4 per cent. Indian financial markets were closed Thursday, Friday and Monday.

I remember one dialogue from an old Hindi movie, where the gangster tells the hero "" barkhodaar humare gang mein aana tumhari marji se hai aur jana humari marji se hai"" (You can enter the gang as per your wish but can leave the gang when I allow you to) or something like that. So, exit from market does not depend on my own wish!

I am investing mostly in illiquid stocks and until and unless the market is not excited by the performance of my company, I cannot get an exit. So this is the first thing.

Second, in my 30 years in investing, I do not remember a single day when I was actually in cash. Even if I sell some shares today, I cannot hold the cash in my bank for more than a month. You can say cash is my enemy and it reflects in my spending habits also. If I have Rs 5,000 in my pocket and I will spend that Rs 5,000.

So, you are not putting incremental cash in the markets at these levels because you are bearish but you still are fully invested.

Fully invested, I do not have cash.

But given that the magnitude of the fall has accelerated in February and March, how did you see six months back those signs and indicators leading to a correction?

I could see because it is a very set pattern of investing. I will give you one example. Whenever the boom in real estate comes, the clerk who is working with the real estate agent, himself turns an and the real estate agents become investors, while the investors become developers. Once they become developers, that means they are God then the God up there, does not like that story!

He has become God only so that the downturn starts. Same thing happened in stock market also and some broker becomes investors, investors becomes consultant, consultant becomes fund managers and fund managers become God.

All these signs were there in the market. It does not mean the market is going to fall further from here and I am not saying that becausethe one thing which I did not like in the market was the euphoria. I felt that should the euphoria was to die down, does that mean the stock will go down 20% or 30%? It varies from stock to stock but the sentiment had become so excited that people have really become blind.

I realised may be this is the time that market should go down although I was invested 100% at that point of time as I am, even now.

If you had a option to create a leverage position and invest right now, do you think this market is looking attractive again? Are you smelling that kind of an opportunity where you want to go all in?

It depends on what is your approach to the market, whether you are investing in a business or in a market or investing in stocks. If you are investing in the business, then I do not mind borrowing the money and investing into stocks, provided I have a long-term horizon for 10 or 15 years or 20 years. But if my approach is to invest in the stocks or the market, then I need to ask my astrologer or my technical chartist where success rate is 10% or 20%.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala often claims that when he spots an opportunity he bets on that stock or that idea disproportionately. In your case, after spotting Atul Auto NSE 0.30 % or Cera Sanitaryware NSE 0.17 %, you aggressively bought into those stocks. After the recent fall in mid and small caps space, what is your approach?

I can book my profit any day. I myself I do not know when as far as borrowing to invest is concerned, the market is not so cheap. Rakesh actually made that statement may be in 2013 when stocks were very cheap. Now market is coming to a reasonable level.

When I bought the stocks you were mentioning, they were available dirt cheap at PE ratio of 5. I do not think this market is so cheap. I am happy with whatever I am holding. if I stay put, if I keep on holding to those stocks I am happy with that.

Some of your profits have come down from the top and that does not worry you at all. You believe that it is a market, it will eventually go up, the losses will be made up.

Worry and investing that these things go together. So, profit is coming down. My age is also coming down and what can I do about it? One should always understand that investing is a stressful business. Blood pressure and diabetes are early visitors to an investor. All these shocks and downswing in the market should not worry you at all because otherwise there is no point of your success. If you do not have good health, if you are not happy, if you do not have peace, then what is the purpose of your millions?

You are sounding a bit cautious about the markets going ahead. How are you managing your portfolio?

As I said, this market is not very cheap and I expect this 2018 to be very volatile.

Why?

Because of various factors. Maybe because Trump, maybe trade war, maybe Indochina relation, so many things are there. That does not mean that I will sell my shares and go to Rajasthan. I am staying put, I will hold my shares but at this point of time I am not comfortable in borrowing money and investing into the market.

No leverage.

No leverage. Yes.

Why Karnataka Bank? Why did you buy Karnataka Bank NSE -2.13 % and why have you sold 40-50% of your position in Karnataka Bank? As per the BSE data, you have sold 30-40 lakh shares in Karnataka Bank.

I do not remember but I am still holding more than 1% so glass is half full or half empty.

Why do you like this story?

Because of the environment. We all know that bank has become a dirty word. There is an identity crisis in the banking sector. Every quarter, there is this problem of NPA is not getting solved and since the stock was liquid and I had opportunity somewhere else so I sold some of my shares with an expectation that if the stock price goes down or even if it does not go down, I will buy again. But right now, I do not know when will I buy or if I will buy. But whatever I am holding, I will hold on to those shares.

As for why did I buy, it was one of the cheapest banking stocks in India as far as private banks are concerned. I have full faith in this management. Even the new management is doing wonders. If you have gone through the place yesterday, they have done exceedingly well. So maybe they have some hiccups, some short-term issues which should be solved very soon.

Would you look to add more may be not in Karnataka Bank, but just banking per se?

, of course although I do not have money but suppose if I sell some shares tomorrow then I would certainly put my money. But there is no certainty in the market and if I put my money into a bank, why not Karnataka Bank? This is not a recommendation. So, let us not talk about the price and all. But I think it is the cheapest bank available although price may go down 10% from here again if some scams breakout tomorrow.

you increased or reduced your exposure in your three large holdings? Would you be selling them if they increase 100% from here, you top three holdings?

100% from here? It depends. Otherwise, I am happy with them.

This is Vijay Kedia’s 2020 portfolio?

This is very difficult to say. Last year, I was expecting that I will not sell Karnataka Bank for five years, but I changed my mind and I sold some of my Karnataka Bank stake.

As of today what happens tomorrow we do not know. As of today…

But I am happy with portfolio. Actually I am watching them very closely and I do not think that I need to sell any of my stock."
918,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 01:59 PM IST",PTI,Visa and Immigration,"Indian companies have dramatically reduced H1B visa filing, reports US daily","WASHINGTON: Indian IT companies have dramatically reduced their H-1B visa filings and foreign nationals are exhibiting reluctance to make the jump to a US company due to the Trump administration's hardline anti-immigration stance, a top Silicon Valley newspaper has said.

San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board has said applicants for the H-1B visa programme are anticipating the hardest process in many years.

""That's affected both the applicants and the companies that employ them,"" it said.

""Indian consulting firms, which have been accused of flooding the system with applications, have dramatically reduced their filings. Foreign nationals are exhibiting new reluctance to make the jump to a US company,"" the paper said as the process for filing H-1B visa application for the 2019 fiscal beginning October 1, kicked off.

The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The Trump administration's hard-line anti-immigration stance is taking its toll, the daily said.

Envoy Global, a technology-oriented immigration services provider, reports that 26 per cent of employers it surveyed have had to delay projects, and 22 per cent of them have relocated work overseas as a result of the current uncertainties in the US immigration system, San Francisco Chronicle said.

The daily argued that study after study has shown that foreign-born workers are good for the US economy and good for US-born workers.

""When companies are allowed to hire the workers with the best skills for the job -- regardless of where those workers happen to have been born -- their increased competitiveness boosts all the industries around them,"" it said.

According to The Wall Street Journal, evidence suggests market demand for H-1B visas is ebbing.

Daniel Culbertson, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, says ""searches related to the H-1B visa, as a share of all searches on Indeed.com, have consistently declined through 2017 and into 2018. In February 2018, searches for H-1B as a share of all searches on our site are down nine percent from the 2017.""

""This also marks the thirteenth consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The decreased interest in H-1B related work from job seekers is a trend, not a temporary shift in preferences,"" he added.

The Wall Street Journal said corporations continue to struggle with a paradoxical labour market where 548,000 tech jobs remain open while unemployment in the technology sector hovers below full employment levels.

""There are lots of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them,"" it said."

Bloomberg


The RBI’s move is also small comfort for India’s banking sector, which has been roiled by a series of fraud and corruption allegations that are expected to impact economic growth.

Here’s what analysts and strategists are saying about the central bank’s decision:

JPMorgan ( Seshadri Sen)
While RBI’s decision to provide some accounting relief eases the pressure on fourth-quarter earnings for banks, it merely postpones the problem to fiscal year 2019 Taking the pressure off bond yields will be a net benefit to public sector banks Decision could trigger a stock rally in the sector and investors should use that “temporary” surge to exit state-run bank stocks as significant changes persist for these banks in terms of low capital ratios, eroding deposit franchises and the need to overhaul credit systems

Nomura ( Adarsh Parasrampuria)
The central bank’s measure will only provide a temporary relief to state-run banks, particularly State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank whose mark-to-market-related provisioning was large in the December quarter This will only be considered as tier-2 capital and will be negative for “capital-starved” state banks The relief is restricted mainly to the losses incurred in third and fourth quarters and any further increase in bond yields from here won’t be spread over

Motilal Oswal Securities ( Shrikant Shetty)
“This could act as a small trigger for the banking stocks today, but no one is going to go berserk as the bigger issues still remain. They still need to be resolved.”

IDFC Securities ( Mahrukh Adajania)
Fourth-quarter earnings will look better but fiscal 2019 will be unchanged Earnings will remain weak and banks may still report losses but they may now be lower than expected

PRB Securities ( Rajendra Wadher)
“The RBI move will be positive for shares of state-owned banks as it will boost their Jan-March quarter earnings. Since banks have already booked their entire Oct-Dec losses, their MTM losses for the Jan-March quarter will come down considerably.” “We expect state-owned banks to outperform broad markets, which may be under pressure due to weak global cues.”"

The telecom operator, on Tuesday, said that the new smart meters will give households and businesses visibility and control over their gas usage, allowing MGL NSE 0.26 % to improve its operational efficiencies.

Tata Communications’ public Internet of Things (IoT)network will provide connectivity to MGL’s smart meters.

“We want to help our customers better understand their energy use, save money and reduce their carbon footprint - while improving our own operational efficiencies,” said Rajeev Mathur, managing director Mahanagar Gas Limited.

As the global smart gas market is set to grow from around $1.59 billion in 2016 to $2.27 billion by 2021, it is expected that there will be around 130 million smart meters across India in the next three years, said Tata Communications in its statement.

This infrastructure is based on an ultra-low-power, long-range network, which enables MGL to simultaneously monitor thousands of smart meters. It means that its customers won’t have to manually check their gas meter readings – instead the smart system will automatically track their gas usage.

“Our recent India –wide research found that the home is where people expect IoT to make a big difference, with over 90% of people surveyed saying that they would like to use IoT to monitor their home appliances remotely in real-time, for example,” said VS Shridhar, senior vice president and head for Internet of Things, Tata Communications.

Tata Communications is building the foundation for IoT in India with the world's largest IoT network, spanning nearly 2,000 communities and touching over 400 million people. To-date, the company has rolled out the LoRaWANTM network in 38 cities, with more cities planned for implementation over the next two years."

The deal has been closed at a pre-money valuation of $3 million and Goyal’s daughter, Carol, will join the board of Sync Media.

Launched last year by media professional Anubhav Sharma, Sync also has Vikas Saxena- the ex-CEO of Nimbuzz and founder of Samgavi - as an early investor in the company.

Sync is an that measures, segments and offers targeted audience to brands by synchronising mainstream media with mobile. It uses advanced, always on, acoustic fingerprinting technology to real-time indexing of every program and ad-airing across over 300+ broadcast and cable network feeds to identify the right timing and the right environment for the placement of a brand advertisement.

“I think Sync Media is one of the pioneers in its space. The synching of television and mobile is an area that excites all brands and digital planners. It gives both enhanced relevance and enhanced conversion to brand campaigns,” said Goyal,

He said, “From my very many years of evangelising the mobile as an advertising medium, I think Sync Media will be at the forefront of technology in the days to come. Mine is an investment in not just the platform but in the innovativeness of its promoters.”

Goyal was earlier a joint venture partner of Dentsu in India. He had sold his 26% stake in the company 2011 for Rs 260 crore. In 2016, he created a Rs 100 crore fund for start-ups. Goyal has already invested in 5-6 start-ups including programmatic advertising company Mozeo and Delhi-headquartered new age communication agency, The Mob.

“Our understanding of offline audiences through superior analytics, delivered by data-driven technology, gives us an edge over others in helping clients make improvements in media planning and delivery in a cost-efficient and cost-effective manner”, says Anubhav Sharma, Managing Partner, Sync Media.

“We are already working with many large digital and media agencies in India. We see great potential for our offering with clients who want offline audiences to be linked to mainline media”.

Sync allows users to know what is really trending on TV, who is watching what, when, and for how long.

“We use this knowledge to help advertisers reach consumers, based on media consumption preferences. What is even better is that we can sync a mobile ad campaign or a Facebook campaign in real time with the TV media plan of a brand. This gives brands higher sales conversions through contextual targeting,” said Vikas Saxena, director, Sync Media.

Sync Media competes with , in which Star India had invested an undisclosed amount for a minority stake.

923,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 05:45 PM IST",PTI,Ind'l Goods/Svs,NCLAT allows parties to settle dispute over Binani Cement sale,"NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) today allowed the parties in dispute over selling of debt-ridden Binani Cement to amicably settle the dispute.

A two-member bench of the appellate tribunal headed by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya gave liberty to the parties entangled in vexatious litigations, to settle the case amicably.

""We give liberty to parties to reach settlement and approach appropriate forum for approval of the settlement,"" the NCLAT said.

The appellate tribunal was hearing a petition filed by Binani Industries, which holds over 90 per cent share in Binani Cement.

""Learned counsel for the appellant submit that appellant has offered a better amount that is 100 per cent approximately of the dues to the committee of creditors (CoC),"" the court said.

As per the IBC code, after a resolution plan is approved by the the CoC, it is forwarded to NCLT for approval.

Earlier, on March 27, the Kolkata bench of NCLT had also suggested that the parties go for settlement.

While Dalmia Bharat has offered an amount of Rs 6,500 crore for Binani Cement, UltraTech NSE 1.99 % of the Aditya Birla Group, which had entered into a bilateral pact with the promoters of Binani, agreed to pay Rs 700 crore more at Rs 7,200 crore.

Binani Cement owes around Rs 7,000 crore to its creditors.

The dispute relates to UltraTech Cement's allegations that the process for choosing the top bidder was not transparent and that the resolution professional (RP) had not followed established best practices. Dalmia Bharat was declared the top bidder.

UltraTech then moved NCLT and also wrote to Binani Cement's RP, offering to increase its bid price. But when it was not accepted, UltraTech struck a deal with Binani Industries to buy its 98.43% stake in the cement unit, provided the insolvency case was terminated.

Binani Industries then approached NCLT asking that the case be terminated."

925,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 01:54 PM IST",PTI,Environment,Extinct monitor lizard had four eyes: Study,"BERLIN: An extinct species of monitor lizard had four eyes, a first among known jawed vertebrates, a fossil study has found. Today, only the jawless lampreys have four eyes, according to researchers at Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany.

The third and fourth eyes refer to pineal and parapineal organs, eye-like photosensory structures on the top of the head that play key roles in orientation and in circadian and annual cycles.

The new findings help to elucidate the evolutionary history of these structures among vertebrates, researchers said.

The photosensitive pineal organ is found in a number of lower vertebrates such as fishes and frogs, they said.

It is often referred to as the ""third eye"" and was widespread in primitive vertebrates.

""On the one hand, there was this idea that the third eye was simply reduced independently in many different vertebrate groups such as mammals and birds and is retained only in lizards among fully land-dwelling vertebrates,"" said Krister Smith from the Senckenberg Research Institute.

""On the other hand, there was this idea that the lizard third eye developed from a different organ, called the parapineal, which is well developed in lampreys. These two ideas did not really cohere,"" Smith said.

By discovering a four-eyed lizard - in which both pineal and parapineal organs formed an eye on the top of the head - the researchers confirmed that the lizard third eye really is different from the third eye of other jawed vertebrates.

Smith and his colleagues got the idea that the fossilised lizards might have a fourth eye after other experts came to contradictory conclusions about where the lizard's third eye was located.

Smith and colleagues turned to museum specimens collected nearly 150 years ago as part of the Yale College Expedition to the Bridger Basin, Wyoming in the US.

CT scans showed that two different individuals had spaces where a fourth eye would have been, which, Smith said, ""I certainly did not expect!"" Their evidence confirms that the pineal and parapineal glands were not a pair of organs in the way that vertebrate eyes are.

They also suggest that the third eye of lizards evolved independently of the third eye in other vertebrate groups.

Smith said that while there is ""nothing mystical"" about the pineal and parapineal organs, they do enable extraordinary abilities.

For instance, they allow some lower vertebrates to sense the polarisation of light and use that information to orient themselves geographically."

It can be noted that although exports account for only 50 per cent of revenue for the domestic pharma industry, its contribution at the operating profit is higher owing to relatively superior profitability of products sold in regulated markets and that the haemorrhage over the past two years can be pinned squarely on dwindling exports to regulated markets, particularly these two markets.

The US and the EU together account for over 90 per cent of the regulated market exports and close to 50 per cent of formulation exports for the domestic companies.

However, the report warns that lower generic opportunity, rising competition, supplier consolidation, and increase in regulatory alerts on domestic plants are the major headwinds for the industry.

Noting that relief from regulatory alerts will result to increase in abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) flows, the report says rising competition and supplier consolidation and the resultant pricing pressure, will continue to impact exports to these key markets in FY19.

Sales to the US and the EU are expected to rise 7 per cent against a decline of 3 per cent between fiscals 2016 and 2018. One of the factors working in favour of larger pharma companies is a marked reduction in the number of regulatory alerts in 2017, a welcome change from 2015 and 2016.

Official action indicated (OAI) came down significantly to 16 in 2017 from 28 in 2014 due to the efforts taken by large formulation companies during these years towards remediation.

Issuance of an OAI indicates objectionable conditions were found and will result in regulatory and/or administrative sanctions by the US. Typically, non-closure of an OAI results in a warning letter or an import alert. Increased efforts towards remediation have also resulted in close-out of some regulatory alerts for big players in the past one year.

""We expect this to continue this year for larger players, allowing them to receive new ANDAs which were stalled owing to these alerts, thereby improving exports,"" it said.

Domestic companies are also likely to benefit from their higher R&D investments over the past few years. Along with developing capabilities through inorganic route, domestic exporters have been focusing on strengthening their in-house product pipeline via R&D due to higher pricing pressure on conventional generics and lower patent expiry opportunity.

They are also shifting focus from conventional generics to complex generics and biosimilars as competition within the conventional generics space is intensifying. The move also ensures healthy growth prospects.

This, though, requires considerably higher R&D investment. For example, cost of developing a biosimilar is around USD 150 million compared to USD 1-5 million to develop a generic drug. While the cost of developing niche complex drugs and biosimilars is substantially high, the potential opportunity and profitability are commensurate.

The higher investment in niche and complex drugs over the past few years is expected to start bearing fruit in fiscal 2019. The number of high value drugs likely to be launched in FY19 is three times over FY18.

Signs of recovery are already visible, with some high value drugs already approved in the past two-three months. For instance, Biocon NSE 1.50 % received approval in December 2017 from the US to launch its biosimilar version of Herceptin-developed jointly with Mylan. Sun Pharmaceuticals got a nod in March 2017 to launch its specialty drug Tildrakizumb."

A standing committee had referred the matter to DGS which in turn issued notice to Jubilant FoodWorks seeking response on whether the benefit of tax rate reduction in November last was passed on to consumers, a source said.

As per the structure of the anti-profiteering mechanism in the GST regime, complaints of local nature will be first sent to the state-level 'screening committee', while those of national level will be marked for the 'standing committee'.

""There were complaints from two consumers to the standing committee regarding over-charging by Dominos Pizza even after the GST rate was cut to 5 per cent from 18 per cent,"" the source told PTI.

In an e-mailed response to queries sent by PTI, Jubilant FoodWorks said:""We are in a silent period now, we would not be (able) to participate in any story.""

In November, the GST Council cut tax rates for all restaurants, except the ones located within hotels with room tariffs of Rs 7,500 and above, to 5 per cent. Prior to reduction, GST was 18 per cent for air-conditioned restaurants and 12 per cent for non-air-conditioned restaurants.

The source further said the notice to Jubilant FoodWorks is one of the 15 profiteering notices sent by DGS so far since the rollout of GST on July 1.

As part of its investigation, DGS asks the company to submit any document it wants to to defend its case.

""Jubilant FoodWorks has replied to the notice in its defence. We are analysing the response and if required further queries would be raised,"" the source added.

After studying the documents, DGS gives its report to the Anti-Profiteering Authority for further action, which may include fine and extreme penalty like cancellation of registration.

If the complaints have merit, the respective committees would refer the cases for further investigation to DGS.

DGS is mandated to complete its investigation within 3 months, and may seek an extension of further 3 months from the standing committee."

935,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 02:39 PM IST",PTI,Science,First age-map of Milky Way galaxy created,"LONDON: The first large-scale age-map of the Milky Way shows that a period of star formation lasting about four billion years created the complex structure at the heart of our galaxy, scientists say.

The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with a bulge at the centre, thousands of light years in diameter, that contains about a quarter of the total mass of stars.

Previous studies have shown that the bulge hosts two components: a population of metal-poor stars that have a spherical distribution, and a population of metal-rich stars that form an elongated bar with a ""waist"", like a bi-lobed peanut.

However, analyses of the ages of the stars to date have produced conflicting results.

Now, an international team led by astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) have analysed the colour, brightness and spectral information on chemistry of individual stars to produce the age-map of the Milky Way.

""We analysed the colour and brightness of stars to find those that have just reached the point of exhausting their hydrogen fuel-burning in the core, which is a sensitive age indicator,"" said researcher Marina Rejkuba.

""Our findings were not consistent with a purely old Milky Way bulge, but require star formation lasting around 4 billion years and starting around 11 billion years ago.

""The youngest stars that we see are at least 7 billion years old, which is older than some previous studies had suggested,"" said Rejkuba, who presented the research at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science (EWASS) in the UK.

The researchers used simulated and observed data for millions of stars from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) infrared survey of the inner Milky Way.

They compared them with measurements of the metal content of around 6,000 stars across the inner bulge from a spectroscopic survey carried out with the GIRAFFE/FLAMES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope (GIBS).

The results presented are based on the analysis of three areas of the VVV infrared map, which, combined, make up the largest area studied so far in the Milky Way bulge.

In all three areas, the findings on the age range of the stars are consistent, researchers said."
936,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 02:46 PM IST",PTI,Sports,CWG: A look at India's medal contenders,"GOLD COAST: With just two days to go for the 21st Commonwealth Games here, takes a look at some of the Indian contingent's top stars and dark horses to watch out for at an event where the country stands fourth in the all-time medal tally.

SHOOTING: India is second in the CWG's all-time medal list for shooting and it is expected that the marksmen and women will once again be contributing a bountiful of medals. Here are some of the strong medal bets.

Heena Sidhu: The feisty pistol shooter from Punjab is in fine form going into the Games, having claimed three gold medals at the Commonwealth Championships a few months ago. She will be competing in the women's 25m pistol and 10m air pistol competitions.

Manu Bhaker: The 16-year-old has been nothing short of sensational with two gold medals (individual and team) in her maiden senior World Cup just weeks ago. She would be lining up alongside Heena in the 10m air pistol event.

Jitu Rai: The diminutive Army shooter is a strong medal hope and would be aiming for a second successive CWG gold in the men's 50m pistol event. The 30-year-old will also try his fortunes in the 10m air pistol competition and a medal in Gold Coast would help heal some of the disappointment of his Olympic failure in 2016 Rio Games.

ATHLETICS: The blue-riband event of all multi-sport extravaganzas, athletics gave India a gold, silver and a bronze in the 2014 CWG.

Neeraj Chopra: The 20-year-old javelin thrower would be a carrying a massive burden of expectations and it remains to be seen how he responds to the spotlight. At the senior world championships in London some months ago, the junior world record-holder failed to qualify for the finals. A gold at last year's Asian Championships is his biggest achievement going into his maiden CWG.

Seema Punia: The discus thrower, who claimed a silver in the Glasgow Games, would be eyeing a golden end to her CWG stint. The 34-year-old achieved two-year best when she threw to 61.05m, which was also a meet record at the Federation Cup last month. It remains to be seen whether the Asian Games champion can better defending gold-medallist and home favourite Dani Stevens and finish on top.

Tejaswin Shankar: The 19-year-old high-jumper bettered his own national record marginally at the Federation Cup last month. He improved it from 2.26m to 2.28m. He can be considered a strong medal hope going by the results of the previous Games where the silver-medallist had jumped 2.28m.

BADMINTON: A gold by P Kashyap was the icing on the cake as the shuttlers returned with four medals from Glasgow and this time, the expectations would be much higher with a star-studded line-up set to take the court.

P V Sindhu: The Olympic silver-medallist is being seen as a sure-shot medallist. She won a bronze in last edition and the world No.3 looks set to change the colour of the medal when she takes the court this time.

Saina Nehwal: Still regaining her fitness after a career-threatening knee surgery, 2010 gold-medallist Saina would be a strong contender too if she manages to remain fit during the event, which she missed in 2014 owing to injuries.

K Srikanth: In the absence of an injured Kashyap, Srikanth would be India's men's singles medal hope and he would aim to do better than the quarterfinal finish of the 2014 Games.

BOXING: There was no gold to show for the last time around and the speculated needle controversy hasn't done them any good here. But the Indians are among the strongest boxing contingents.

M C Mary Kom: A colossal figure not just in India boxing but international boxing as well, the 35-year-old Mary Kom would be, hold your breath, making her CWG debut here. The five-time world champion and Olympic bronze-medallist is a favourite to pick up the 48kg gold and make her first and last CWG a memorable affair.

Vikas Krishan: One of India's just four men's world medallists, Vikas has come here after claiming a gold at the prestigious Strandja Memorial Tournament in Bulgaria in February. Like Mary Kom, Vikas will also be making his debut at the Games and would be a strong contender in the 75kg division.

Amit Panghal: The diminutive light flyweight 49kg boxer is also a debutant but one with quite a bit of experience of competing on the big stage. He was a quarterfinalist at last year's world championships and won a bronze at the Asian Championships. Amit had claimed a gold at the Strandja Memorial earlier this year.

WRESTLING: India are second in the CWG all-time medal list of wrestling and are expected to dominate this time around as well.

Sushil Kumar: The gold-medallist from 2014 is making a comeback to big-ticket wrestling after an injury-hampered and controversy filled two years. The double Olympic medallist would be aiming for another gold when he competes in 74kg men's freestyle event.

Sakshi Malik: The Rio bronze-medallist has been in good form and would be expected to better the silver medal she claimed at the Glasgow Games. She would be in action in the 62kg freestyle event.

Vinesh Phogat: 2014 Gold medallist, Vinesh suffered a career-threatening injury at the Rio Olympics but she returned to win a silver medal (55kg) at the Asian Championship and claimed the gold at National Championships. She would be a medal contender when she competes in 50kg this time.

SQUASH: A women's doubles gold in 2014 opened India's CWG account in squash and Dipika Pallikal and Joshna Chinnappa would once again look to ensure that India have something to celebrate but it remains to be seen whether a singles medal will come along too from either of the two and Sourav Ghosal in the men's singles.

WEIGHTLIFTING: World champion Mirabai Chanu (48kg), with a Commonwealth record under her belt, and a personal best which is 10kg better than her nearest rival at this event, is expected to open the gold rush for India."

939,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 05:03 PM IST",ET Online,Auto,Will auto sector bring Modi some respite from India's raging job crisis?,"NEW DELHI: Recently, the railways received more than two crore applications for about one lakh vacancies. So many people chasing so few low-level government jobs points out that there is a dearth of jobs in the private sector and people fall back on government jobs due to uncertainty in the jobs market.

Job creation has become a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he has only one year left to face the people in Lok Sabha polls in 2019. He had promised to create 10 million jobs a year during his campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The labour ministry’s figures released on March 12 show India added 136,000 workers across eight sectors between July to October 2017. However, in the week ended Feb. 25, India’s jobless rate rose to 6.1 per cent compared to 5 per cent in January, the highest monthly rate in the past 15 months, according to the data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed.

Amid the crisis of jobs all over the economy, one sector stands out as a ray of hope—the auto industry.

India’s automobile industry just had its best fiscal year with data from manufacturers showing all-time high sales across segments. Analysts expect the momentum to continue in the new financial year, as economic activity is improving as well. Cumulative domestic vehicle sales growth in the past year was 13-15%, hitting the double-digit mark for the first time since fiscal 2012.

According to industry experts, there are several reasons behind this spike in sales — introduction of GST, which resulted in free movement of goods; crackdown on overloaded vehicles; increased investment in infrastructure; efficiency improvement in load carrying, especially by the ecommerce segment; increase in last-mile connectivity in hundreds of cities and towns; and pent-up demand and deferred purchase due to demonetisation, GST implementation and new emission regulations.

The commercial vehicle segment, seen as a barometer of economic activity, is estimated to have recorded sales of over 8.8 lakh units in the past fiscal year, growing 23% from the year before, with medium and heavy vehicles eclipsing the previous peak posted in FY12

The two-wheeler, three-wheeler and commercial vehicle segments have each posted record double-digit growth, despite uncertainty over the implementation of GST and transition to new emission standards. In passenger vehicles, the industry is projecting a high-single-digit expansion for fiscal 2018. The local two-wheeler market is estimated to have crossed the 20-million-unit milestone, with sales growing 14%, helped by strong demand in the rural areas after good rains last monsoon. The three-wheeler output (domestic and exports combined) likely ended the year close to the 1-million mark, with growth of more than 25%.



The Indian automobile sector is set to witness a pickup in hiring over the next 12 months, largely driven by the passenger vehicle segment which has seen many launches in the last year, in addition to the advent of new technologies in areas such as electrified and driverless vehicles. A recent study carried out by HR services firm PeopleStrong predicts the automobile industry to hire 8-12% more employees in fiscal 2019.

Maruti NSE 0.20 % Suzuki and Tata Motors, India’s top two vehicle makers, will together add as many as 4,500 employees this fiscal year to deal with their growing product portfolio and sales. A Tata Motors spokesperson said hiring at Tata Motors was largely for replacement last year, but this year it was much higher and incremental in order to manage growth.

A bulk of the hiring will be concentrated in the research and development (R&D) segment with a lot of it happening in areas of design, engine and fuel side, says the study. The R&D segment will see a 12-15% increase in fiscal 2019 in hiring."

The much-awaited mega health insurance scheme or Modicare, which is targeting to insure 40 per cent of the population, recently received the Cabinet approval and would now be formally launched from Jangla health centre in Bijapur district. Apart from Modicare, the Prime Minister would also unveil a lesser-known scheme – Van Dhan Yojana.

Following Jan Dhan Yojana, the scheme has been targeted towards empowering the tribals by training them in collecting and processing minor forest produce. The ministry of tribal affairs would provide support for training tribals in adding value to products like imli at home through basic methods. The first training centre would be unveiled by Modi in Bijapur.

The date has been carefully chosen – Dr B R Ambedkar’s birth anniversary. According to sources, the Prime Minister would begin his day by paying floral tributes to Ambedkar at Parliament and then unveil the flagship programmes in Chhattisgarh. The choice of Bijapur is significant as it is a Naxal-infested low literacy district.

With the launch of two major flagship programmes in the last mile of Modi government, the BJP is hoping to address the poorest of the poor of India from the tribal district. While BJP has tried to make in-roads in tribal belts of various states, the Congress has maintained its supremacy in this dedicated votebank.

By unveiling pro-poor programmes on Ambedkar Jayanti, the BJP government is sending a clear signal to Dalits and tribals which comprise almost half the population of the poll-bound state. While Scheduled Castes comprise 12.82per cent of the population, tribals are 30.6per cent -- which translates to 44per cent of the total population of the state.

BJP has been in power in Chhattisgarh since 2003. Three-term chief minister Raman Singh is facing obvious anti-incumbency. However, the contest is keener in the forthcoming Assembly elections as the newly-formed state would witness its first triangular fight in the largely bipolar polity.

Former chief minister and tribal leader Ajit Jogi has left the Congress and formed his own Chhattisgarh Janata Congress which would queer the pitch in a state where the difference in voteshare of BJP and Congress in 2013 was less than 1per cent ."

943,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 03:15 PM IST",ET Bureau,Economy,Profit margins of tea producers to improve: ICRA,"Profit margins for bulk tea players, particularly the North Indian producers, are set to improve in FY2018. Firm price trends in North Indian teas from August, 2017 to January, 2018 have supported the margins and debt coverage indicators of most large bulk tea producers based out of the region in FY2018, said an ICRA NSE 0.33 % note released on Tuesday.

Notwithstanding the improvement, the overall performance will remain weak on an absolute basis. Going forward, the new wage agreement, that would be applicable for tea plantation workers in the states of Assam and West Bengal, would be the single most crucial factor determining the performance of organized North Indian bulk tea players. Although the revised wage rates are currently under negotiation, ICRA understands, based on discussions with industry players, that a steep increase in wage rates is likely. If such an increase is indeed implemented, organized bulk tea players would witness a considerable decline in operating margins, unless there is a commensurate increase in prices of tea on a sustainable basis.

Commenting on the likely increase in wage rates going forward, Mr. , Vice President and Sector Head, Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA said, “Based on discussions with industry players, we understand that there is a possibility of a steep increase of around 25% in wage rates over the next couple of years. If such an increase is indeed implemented, organized bulk tea players based in North India would witness a considerable deterioration in operating margins, unless there is a commensurate rise in prices of tea on a sustainable basis. As per ICRA estimates, a minimum price increase of around 15% would be required to cushion the impact of higher wages.”

Domestic price trends remain a function of cropping patterns, combined with demand levels across quality grades. Export volumes also play a vital role in maintaining the overall demand-supply balance in the domestic market. The all-India auction averages had registered a marginal decline of around 0.9% during CY2017, primarily due to the softer trend in South Indian auction realisations on the back of higher production levels. Such increase in production has cushioned the impact of declining prices, and South Indian producers are unlikely to witness any material contraction in operating profitability during FY2018.

On the other hand, North Indian weekly auction prices, which were also soft initially, firmed up considerably during H2 CY2017, supported by healthy demand in both the export and the domestic markets, coupled with lower availability of tea on the back of periods of reduced cropping in certain regions. Although the trend continued into January, 2018, reduced auction activity and sale of lower quality end-of-season produce has had an adverse impact on price trends in recent weeks. Average auction prices across most international centres, however, remained buoyant, maintaining the trend witnessed in CY2017.

On the production front, CY2018 has started on a positive note, with aggregate tea production across major tea-producing nations increasing by 12% in January, 2018, primarily driven by the 24% increase in Kenyan production and 14% increase in Sri Lankan production during the month. Although India recorded a 10.5% decline in production during the month, ICRA notes that domestic cropping trends in January are not indicative of the full-year pattern, since the full-year trend will primarily be determined by cropping levels in North India during the peak tea producing months of June to October.

Over the long term, domestic tea production growth is estimated to remain range bound, given the limited availability of land for incremental tea plantation. This, combined with a favourable long-term domestic demand outlook for tea is likely to support prices to some extent over the long term.

“However, the actual movement in price levels, relative to the trend in cost pressures going forward, will remain the key determinant of the financial health of domestic bulk tea players,” Mr. Das added."

Well, here is the scoop. We have a list of eight schemes that managed the rare feat since 2009. These equity schemes have managed to stay on top of the charts based on their five-year CAGR returns.

Here is how we found them: we took out equity- oriented mutual fund schemes -- including largecap, midcap, multicap, and ELSS funds -- which have remained toppers in the five-year periods in a row. We used 5-year CAGR returns to take out the top schemes.

After applying certain filters (for details, read: How we did it? ), we got eight schemes which have been among the top 10 schemes on the basis of their 5-year CAGR returns, starting from April 2009. See table below for the topper schemes.

How we did it?
We extracted data for diversified equity funds, including largecap, midcap, multicap and ELSS category. We only considered open-ended schemes with growth option for the study. Next, we extracted 5-year CAGR returns from April 1 to March 31 for five consecutive periods. This way, we had CAGR returns for periods: Apr 01 2009 to Mar 31 2014, Apr 01 2010 to Mar 2015, Apr 01 2011 to Mar 2016, Apr 01 2012 to Mar 2017, Apr 01, 2013 to Mar 2018.

We specifically used 5-year CAGR returns as equities are recommended for longer time period of five years and more. Next, we filtered top 10 schemes on the basis of 5-year CAGR return in all the periods mentioned above. Those schemes which were a part of the top 10 schemes in all the mentioned periods were taken out. We performed the same steps to take out the toppers in all categories separately.

One limitation to this study is that we might have missed some good schemes which have been consistent performers for all the years since their inception, but have not completed the required number of years to get past our research filter."

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Anjani Kumar Srivastava turned down the plea of Shashwat, filed by his counsel Veeresh Kumar Mishra, Public Prosecutor Satya Narayan Prasad Sah said.

Shashwat was named in one of the two FIRs lodged in the aftermath of the communal riots which took place on March 17, on the occasion of New Year as per the Hindu calendar.

Violence had erupted in Nathnagar area of the district, when people belonging to a minority community took exception to the loud music played at a procession.

Several people, including two police personnel, were injured in the clashes.

The district administration had also claimed that the procession was taken out without obtaining due permission.

Shashwat was arrested in Patna in the early hours of Sunday, barely a few hours after a Bhagalpur court rejected his petition for an anticipatory bail. He had filed the plea following the issuance of an arrest warrant against him a week earlier.

Upon his arrest, he was produced before a Bhagalpur court which remanded him to 14 days in judicial custody.

Shashwat had unsuccessfully contested the 2015 Assembly polls from Bhagalpur as the BJP candidate.

His father is the Union Minister of State for Health and an MP from Buxar.

The Nitish Kumar government in Bihar had drawn a lot of flak on account of the delay in the arrest of Shashwat. The RJD had said that the CM was ""helpless"" before the BJP."

Besides, it has signed two bilateral APAs with the US during the month, a CBDT statement said.

""With the signing of these agreements, the total number of APAs entered into by CBDT has gone up to 219. This includes 199 unilateral APAs and 20 bilateral APAs,"" it said.

A total of 67 APAs (9 bilateral and 58 unilateral) have been signed in 2017-18.

The 16 APAs during March pertain to sectors like telecom, IT, automobile, pharmaceutical, beverage, banking and insurance.

The international transactions covered in these agreements include payment of royalty fee, provisions of business support services, marketing support services, engineering design services, engineering support services, among others.

While unilateral pacts involve only the taxpayer and the tax authority of the country where the taxpayer is located, bilateral agreements involve the taxpayer, associated enterprise of the taxpayer in the foreign country, the tax authority of the country where the taxpayer is located and the foreign tax authority.

The progress of the APA scheme strengthens the government's resolve of fostering a non-adversarial tax regime, the statement added.

The APA scheme was introduced in the Income-Tax Act in 2012 and the 'Rollback' provisions were introduced in 2014.

The scheme endeavours to provide certainty to taxpayers in the domain of transfer pricing by specifying the methods of pricing and setting the prices of international transactions in advance. JD ANU ANU"

He said what drives productivity is pertinent when it comes to innovation and is a very relevant question for India as it seeks to move up the ladder from low middle income to high income country.

Releasing a World Bank report on innovation in developing countries, he said: ""I think we can do a Silicon Valley in India in the next five years..as the world is changing, we can leapfrog.

""I believe firm size, firm capability and innovation have a strong relationship. More needs to be done in the innovation ecosystem in India where firms continue to remain stagnant.""

In developing countries, the concept of national innovation system must be expanded, said the World Bank Chief Economist for Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions, William F Maloney.

According to the report, investments for innovation often consist of marginal improvements in process or products, rather than significant technology adoption or new product imitation.

""They very rarely involve frontier research...if a firm (or country) invests in innovation but cannot also import the necessary technology, contract or hire trained workers and engineers, or draw on new organisational techniques, the returns to that investment will be low.""

Returns from investments in research and development (R&D) rise initially, but lack of complementary factors over time result in their decline, the report said.

""The policy maker's conception of the national innovation system (NIS) must go beyond the usual institutions and policies designed to offset standard innovation-related market failures. The scope of the NIS must include broader complementary factors and supporting institutions,"" it added.

Further, innovation cannot be supply driven, there must be demand from firms that have the capabilities to innovative.

""On this demand side, the firm and its decisions to innovate, policy makers must be concerned with the incentives for firms to accumulate the necessary physical, human and knowledge capital,"" Maloney said."
954,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 03:51 PM IST",PTI,Not Available,Median salary for analytics professionals in India rose 8 pc in 2017: Study,"NEW DELHI: The median salary for analytics professionals in India in 2017 stood at Rs 12.7 lakh per annum across experience levels and skill sets, an 8 per cent increase over the year-ago period, says a study.

The salary study by analytics learning platform Great Learning and Analytics India Magazine, noted that the median salary of professionals in this space is on an uptrend and there is more demand for senior professionals in this space.

""The monetary perk of a career in data analytics is huge. Organisations, irrespective of their industries, are looking for analytics professionals with diverse skill sets. Job roles like machine learning engineers, data scientists, data mining specialists, cloud architects and cyber security analysts are in heavy demand and command good salary,"" said Hari Krishnan Nair, Co-founder, Great Learning.

Sector-wise, telecom offers the highest average salaries in analytics, followed by retail and energy sectors.

The percentage of analytics professionals earning more than Rs 15 lakh per annum has increased from 17 per cent in 2016 to 21 per cent in 2017, to 22.3 per cent in 2018.

""Machine learning and analytics skills can easily yield a net package of 12-14 lakh per annum. However, to be successful in this profession, upskilling oneself with the latest technology is imperative. We are entering an age of lifelong learning,"" Nair added.

As per the report, there is still a long way to attain pay parity across genders, in this profession. Women analytics professionals earn 32 per cent lesser salaries compared to their male counterpart.

In terms of cities, Mumbai continues to be the highest paymaster in analytics at almost Rs 13.3 lakh per annum, followed by Bengaluru at Rs 12.5 lakh.

Chennai and Hyderabad are the lowest paymasters at Rs 10.2 lakh per year.

The study, however, noted that while the salary of analytics professionals across various industries and specialisations are improving steadily, the IT sector has shown a downward trend with lowest analytics salaries this year.

""IT service providers, primarily providing services to analytics clients across the globe, have been affected the most with their analytics salaries going down. This can be largely attributed to the overall negative impact on IT sector such as automation, and increased attrition rate in the IT space,"" said Bhasker Gupta, Founder and CEO, Analytics India Magazine."

959,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 03:55 PM IST",,Expert Views,Ashok Leyland likely to see another 10% growth in coming year: Gopal Mahadevan,"In an interview with ET Now, Gopal Mahadevan, CFO, Ashok Leyland NSE 0.36 % says, “We have posted about 14% growth in volumes.” Edited excerpts:

ET Now: With the growth momentum in the CV industry going strong, would you say it is because of changes at the macro level or is there a change in consumer preference at play?

Gopal Mahadevan: It has been a good year for the Indian M&HCV industry. We have posted about 14% growth in volumes. This has been driven by three reasons- one has been the infrastructure spend in the country. It has really caught on. If you look at the north-eastern, central and northern sides of the country, you will see investments in infrastructure, especially in roads. That has taken on the demand for multi axle vehicles.

DID YOU KNOW?
Stock score of Ashok Leyland Ltd moved up by 2 in 3 months on a 10-point scale.

 »
The second reason is GST. GST has had a very positive effect. Before the GST roll out, I had said earlier that if the productivity of vehicles increases, you would see more investments coming in and that is exactly what has happened. We have seen that the turnaround times have improved; we have seen larger fleet operators putting in more investments into the sector.

The third reason has been regulatory changes. From states like Rajasthan, UP etc., we have greater loads coming in, leading to an increase in demand for trucks. Overall we can see that the profitability of freight operators has improved. We have seen a lot of investment coming into the sector. How will the New Year look that we will have to take a guess but I think at this point in time we can expect if the infrastructure spends were to continue and if things stabilise, we should see another 10% growth in the forthcoming year.

ET Now: Give us a sense of demand uptick on the back of overloading norms, pre-buying ahead of the BS VI transition and CV scrappage policy?

Gopal Mahadevan: I think if the load regulations were to spread across the country it would be very positive for the industry and also for general freight operations. This is because overloading is not a good thing to have. It has multiple implications including impact on roads.

The second thing is a lot of uncertainty of the past has stabilised now. We have gone through demonetisation, then we have had the BS III to BS IV change and then after that we had GST implementation. So, we have had to weather a lot of change over the last possibly 12 to 18 months. Things have stabilised now and if the economy were to grow, I do not see any reason why the commercial vehicle industry will not.

As far as scrappage policy is concerned, it is more towards 2020 and if the government were to implement it with an incentive led solution for customers to face out old vehicles it should add quite significantly to the total industry volume. But that is still some distance away.

ET Now: LCVs are consistently growing at a run rate of over 50%. What are the multiple levers that are boosting this segment? Will this segment be pushed forth by the company going ahead as well?

Gopal Mahadevan: LCV is a very important business for us and we will continue to invest further into it. We have grown very healthily in the current year. Our volumes have been about 43000 units and the last month too saw a very healthy number. We will be coming out with five to six new product launches over the next 12 to 14 months. One of the positive benefits of GST is the clear segmentation that the market is getting into. You have a very clear long haulage market, the ICV market is also growing and spoke arrangement, which GST has kind of helped to gather on the ground, has grown. This growth has not been restricted to only the heavy duty vehicles but has extended to the ICV and the LCV segments. This huge demand for LCV will continue into the New Year.

ET Now: High tonnage vehicles are also witnessing a strong growth. You had previously guided for a 10% growth of MHCVs in FY18, does that hold still or would you revise it since demand remains higher than expected?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, we hope that the industry surprises us and grows faster than the rate that I am cautiously sharing with you. It looks pretty good at the moment but we will have to see how it pans out. A positive in the industry, very clearly, is moving towards multi axle vehicles, especially 37 tonners. The freight operators are also seeing the benefit of owning larger vehicles because the economics of scale are clearly established when you go in for larger vehicles. Similarly, the end customers now prefer larger vehicles. We are seeing a clear shift towards heavier vehicles as we move forward. Do not be surprised if the industry moves from 37 tonners to 41-42 tonners. The 49 tonner demand is also going up.

ET Now: The increased prices to some extent can take care of the rising raw material cost. Now that fear of pricing and discipline has been abated, what kind of margin expansion can we expect you to deliver?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, I cannot give a forecast on what will be our margins but we have been posting double digit EBITDA margins for quite a bit of quarters now, save for last year’s July result. We will continue with that policy. We have our plans for growing in place and we have a network which has expanded sufficiently well. We have new products to be launched but at the same time we will want to ensure that we keep our costs intact and grow profitably. Hopefully you will see some improvement in margins in the forthcoming year but it is a little too early to state.

ET Now: Are you on track to increase the share of your non-core businesses like defence, exports and aftermarket to 50% of the overall revenue pie as guided by you?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, we have not shared a specific 50% mark but what we want to do is to devolatise the company from two things; one is domestic, the second one is truck. We would pursue growth in the domestic truck business fervently but we would also want to grow other businesses faster if possible. So, those are typically the defence business, the LCV business, the bus business, the international revenues and the aftermarket. We are very satisfied with the growth rates that these businesses have posted. We have retained our leadership in the bus business in FY18 also and we will pursue that strategy as we move forward. There will be a change in the overall mix over the next three to five years because we are putting in all the relevant building blocks for this strategy. We have been investing into international business. We have invested quite heavily into the defence business also. And by investments, I do not mean, large lumpy capex. It is more about strategy and putting people in place, getting the networks in place, getting the necessary infrastructure and we are very satisfied with the progress that the company is making."
960,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 03:53 PM IST",PTI,Internet,"Games like Candy Crush can be used for data harvesting, warn experts","NEW DELHI: Free mobile and Facebook apps as well as games such as Candy Crush, Ludo and Chess can be potential tools for data harvesting, say cyber security experts, warning internet users in India against the seemingly innocuous everyday pastimes.

The warning comes as debates on data privacy intensify following social media giant Facebook's reported data breach by UK-based analytics firm Cambridge Analytica to influence elections and market campaigns.

""There are a lot users who play games like Candy Crush, Chess, Ludo, or other war games like Mini Militia. Some people click on 'free' apps like 'How would you look 30 years from now' and all that stuff.

""But we must remember one thing. Nothing is free in life. If you think the product is free, sorry, then you are the product!"" leading cyber security expert Jiten Jain told PTI.

India's ""most active"" smartphone users spend four hours a day on mobile apps, according to an article on the website of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the UN's specialised agency for information and communication technologies.

Indians also downloaded 6.2 billion apps in 2016, up from 3.6 billion in 2015, as they led the field in the ""most time spent"" on Android devices by clocking 145 billion hours, it added, indicating the massive spread of mobile phone applications and games in the country.

Several apps on mobile phones and Facebook use data harvesting techniques and take users' consent in terms and conditions to access their data, including name, age, 'likes', friends and messages, posing a threat to privacy, cautioned Jain.

""Data harvesting"" is the process of extracting large amount of data for analytics by ""consent"" of the user, sometimes even by tricking them, Jain said. ""Data theft"", on the other hand, is the unauthorised use of that information for commercial or any other purpose, he explained.

Data harvesting, Jain elaborated, is mostly by some sort of consent, while data theft is largely by unauthorised access or hacking into a user's profile or device.

It is imperative that data subjects become vigilant about their privacy while visiting a website, added Jaspreet Singh, partner, Cyber Security, Ernst & Young.

""Users should make sure they are validating the terms and conditions of any personal information provided online especially on social media,"" he said.

Read privacy policies of websites and understand how they may use or share their personal information in the future, Singh said in his ""advisory"". Users should also be wary while sharing their location on the internet.

""Web cookies are used to de-anonymize a user and track their activities online. Users may use private browsing or browsers with add-ons to block monitoring using cookies,"" he said.

According to Rama Vedashree, CEO of Data Security Council of India, youths comprise the majority of internet users in the country and it is imperative to increase awareness about online safety.

""Make sure that all of them have adequate awareness, knowledge and skill to leverage the power of these technologies and platforms (analytics and social media) but also stay safe -- both from security perspective and privacy,"" she said.

On social media platforms, for instance, users can control their posts, choosing to make them visible only to their friends or friends of friends or everyone.

Supreme Court lawyer Pavan Duggal, who specialises in cyber issues and argues for dedicated legislation for data protection or data privacy, said users should think through the terms and conditions before granting any apps access to their personal pictures or documents.

""Do not wait for the law to come in for it will take its own time. Be conscious about what you share online. Be aware that you are not being respected and seen only as a 'data subject' or 'data object' who is only providing them data on a 24*7 basis,"" Duggal said.

""You should understand the internet as a paradigm never sleeps, and never forgets,"" he said.

What's uploaded online will remain there for a ""long, long time"", he added.

There are several cases pending in courts where people's data has been unauthorisedly accessed and they have sought either damages or other relief, he said.

""Since the Information Technology Act does not have very effective remedies, we haven't yet seen much successful judgements. Further, there are no convictions in the country for breaches or misuse of personal data on social media,"" Duggal said.

According to ITU data, by June 2017 as many as 830 million young people were online, representing 80 per cent of the youth population in 104 countries. In China and India alone, up to 320 million young people use the internet, it said."

The meetings that took place at the Central Hall of Parliament were aimed at garnering support for the no-confidence motion against the NDA government moved by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

The TDP snapped its ties with the BJP alleging neglect of the southern state and failure of the Centre to grant special category state status to Andhra Pradesh.

Naidu also met Farooq Abdullah (NC), Sudip Bandyopadhyay (TMC), D Raja (CPI), V Maitreyan (AIADMK), Anupriya Patel (Apna Dal) and Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party) among others, according to a statement issued by the chief minister's media unit.

In an apparent swipe at the Narendra Modi dispensation, TDP MP T G Venkatesh told reporters earlier in the day, ""The chief minister is meeting key leaders in Parliament to send across a message to the country that not only making commitments, but honouring it also is very important.""

The TDP has alleged that the Centre failed to fulfil its commitments toward Andhra Pradesh, after the state was bifurcated in 2014.

TDP floor leader in Parliament, Thota Narasimham said, ""The Centre is simply adjourning the House as they do not have answers to various questions that the opposition parties may put forth if the no-confidence motion is taken up for discussion. They say they have majority, then why not take it up?"""

Eastbridge has raised its stake from the current 5.79 percent to 9.73 percent according to its filings to SEBI. Last week the Fortis board approved the demerger of its hospitals business to Manipal and TPG Capital, along with 20% in diagnostics chain SRL in an Rs 3,900-crore deal. However the deal had not gone down well with minority shareholders who had expressed their concerns about the valuation.

On Tuesday Bloomberg reported that brokerage firm Citi and Nomura downgraded Fortis shares. While Citi downgraded the shares to Rs 120 from the previous target price of Rs 178, Nomura wrote since the funds will mostly go towards settling existing liabilities, interim capex and interest payments the use of the proceeds is seen as a “negative surprise” and will diminish the overall equity value for existing Fortis shareholders.

Last week ET had reported how minority shareholders were dumping the Fortis shares unhappy with the valuation.

CBI sources had said that Rs 4.63 crore was allegedly received through Prayas Info Solutions, Akinchan Developers, Managalyatan Projects and Indo-Metal Impex Pvt Limited in 2015-16.

They had said Jain and his wife were allegedly holders of one-third of the shares in these companies during the period.

During CBI questioning, the minister and his wife could not explain the source of Rs 1.62 crore, approximately one-third of the funds received by the companies during 2015-17, they had said.

The CBI has alleged that Jain had control over these companies either in the form of being one of the directors and by holding one-third of shares of these companies in his name or in the names of his family members or others.

The probe agency had also claimed that these were shell firms used for parking money in the form of investments in equity shares in connivance with Kolkata-based shell companies.

""This apart, before becoming a public servant, he was allegedly involved in laundering Rs 11.78 crore during 2010-12 through these companies as well as other firms also based in New Delhi,"" the CBI had said.

""This apart, before becoming a public servant, he was allegedly involved in laundering Rs 11.78 crore during 2010-12 through these companies as well as other firms also based in New Delhi,"" the CBI had said.

The funds were allegedly used to purchase over 200 bighas of land in Auchandi, Bawana, Karala and Mohammed Mazvi villages in Delhi between 2010-16, CBI sources had said.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), however, had refuted the CBI's allegations and said that reports of Jain's involvement in shell companies and benami land deals were ""baseless"".

Jain, also the minister for home, PWD, industries and urban development, is an MLA from the Shakurbasti constituency.

The ED probe will focus if he and other accused in the case created illegal assets by laundering the alleged tainted funds."

MUMBAI/BENGALURU: The Gsat-6A remained incommunicado for the third day after its launch even as it moved over Africa and then towards the southern tip of India, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and over the Pacific Ocean on Monday.

Data from the US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) showed all three stages of placing it in orbit had gone off without a hitch.
“It was like a cardiac arrest,” one Isro insider said about the sudden blackout of the Rs 270-crore satellite.

Isro said efforts were on to resume communication with the satellite. Sources said there was no indication of any system malfunction or fluctuations during or after launch. “Every time there is a discrepancy, there are indications. This time, it could not been seen or felt, which is why it is taking more time to establish contact,” Isro chairman K Sivan said.

The Gsat-6A was to help the armed forces communicate from remote border areas and the mountains.

Private real-time satellite tracking websites have also been tailing the Gsat-6A job since its launch. One of them, n2yo.com, showed that around 2.30pm on Monday, the spacecraft was flying at a speed of 3.38km per second at an altitude of 28,517km.

By 6pm, its altitude had dropped to 5,140km. An Isro official said the altitude changed because thesatellite was following an elliptical orbit; the speed and altitude will change “every fraction of a second”. It is expected to remain this way till the spacecraft reaches its final geosynchronous home orbit 36,000km above the earth, he added.

Director of the Mumbai based Akash Ganga Centre for Astronomy, Bharat Adur, said the Norad data showed there was no functional or orbiting problem, as of now. “The problem seems to be in the spacecraft’s application area,” he said.

Information about the satellite can be accessed from another live satellite tracking network, Calsky, which is providing various parameters and updating them constantly. So far, none of this data has signalled what might have caused the communication blackout.

Sources said if the satellite does come back on track, it would have enough fuel to make progress. Encouragingly, the last communication with the satellite indicated good health of all systems.

Power system
The spacecraft, just like its predecessor Gsat-6, is equipped with a power system of onboard solar panels that could generate more than 3,000 watts, and a back-up of 100 Ah Li-Ion batteries to be used during probable eclipses. Isro has not been able to say whether the existing power back-ups failed to act and if an additional redundancy system for power was needed."

The national capital-based Crystal Crop Protection today announced the acquisition of certain seed and fodder business from Syngenta India.

Syngenta's decision to sell part of its seed business comes in the wake of government's control over Indian seed market by fixing maximum sale price and royalty value for the technology provider.

""The company has acquired Indian grain sorghum, fodder sorghum (SSG) and pearl millet seeds business including their germplasms, plant variety protection applications and registrations and market authorisations from Syngenta,"" Crystal Crop Protection said in a statement.

The company has also acquired seed brands Mahalaxmi (Sorghum), Atheeva (Pearl Millet) and SX-17 (SSG), it said.

""Syngenta is divesting the pearl-millet, sorghum and fodder business to bring stronger focus and synergy to its core diversified field crop and vegetable seeds strategy,"" Syngenta India, South Asia Vice President (Business Sustainability) K C Ravi said in a separate statement.

Crystal Crop will now have strong breeding program in all its focus crops -- cotton, maize, rice, grain sorghum, pearl millet and SSG, he added.

The company, however, did not disclose the deal amount. Ernst & Young LLP acted as advisor to Syngenta on the above divestment.

""We believe in taking technology, innovation and manufacturing to the next level. With acquisition of seeds from Syngenta, we will strengthen our seed portfolio,"" Crystal Crop Protection Managing Director Ankur Aggarwal said.

Crystal Crop has made a number of acquisitions in past few years. In the last fiscal, the company had acquired a speciality chemicals plant from Cytec India Specialty Chemicals and Materials Pvt Limited, an Indian unit of Belgian chemicals firm Solvay SA.

In October and November which is a peak burning season in Punjab, about half of all pollution in Delhi can be attributed to agricultural fires on some days, said the study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.

""On certain days during peak fire season, air pollution in Delhi is about 20 times higher than the threshold for safe air as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO),"" said first author Daniel H. Cusworth from Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

To model how much of that pollution is coming from the fires, the researchers used satellite data from NASA to identify hotspots corresponding to active fires.

The team gathered available data for October and November, 2012 to 2016 and plugged it into a particle dispersion model -- an algorithm that accounts for geography, wind patterns, and physics to predict how far and in what direction smoke particles travel.

During the post-monsoon season, the air in northern India was particularly stagnant, implying that smoke particles don't vent into the atmosphere as they would during other times of the year.

""Instead, the black carbon and organic particulate matter slowly permeates throughout the entire region, which is home to 46 million people. In urban areas, that smoke mixes with existing pollution from cars and factories creating a thick, deadly haze,"" the paper highlighted.

On average, without fires, urban Delhi experiences about 150 micrograms per cubic metre of fine particulate air pollution.

WHO puts the threshold for safe air at 25 micrograms per cubic metre and country's Central Pollution Control Board limits exposure to 60 micrograms per cubic metre, added Cusworth and senior research fellow Loretta J. Mickley.

Extreme fires during the post-monsoon season can pump on average about 150 micrograms per cubic metre of fine particulate matter into the city, doubling the amount of pollution and increasing total levels 12 times higher than WHO recommendations and even 20 times higher on some days, the researchers said.

Trump says he is ready to fight a trade war with China. But he may not have the ground to wage such a war because the trade deficit could actually be 10 times less.

A recent report by Deutsche Bank points out that the trade deficit doesn't account for hundreds of billions of dollars in sales made by subsidiaries that the US companies run in China.

""The US business interests in China are much larger than what the trade data shows. The looming trade war puts these interests at risk,"" said the Deutsche Bank report.

""General Motors, Apple, and other US companies manufactured and sold a combined total of $223 billion in goods through their Chinese branches in 2015. This figure was not factored into Sino-US trade numbers,"" says China's state-run news outlet Global Times.

""The German bank report also indicated the total revenue earned from US exports to China and revenue earned from its branch sales in China added up to $373 billion, despite Chinese companies achieving $403 billion in the US market. The number means the trade deficit lands at $30 billion, a far cry from the $365.7 billion figure originally claimed by Washington,"" says an editorial in Global Times.

The editorial says there are several other factors which weigh against China in its trade with the US, and the US tends to ignore these.

""Outside of the subsidiaries factor covered by Deutsch Bank, other factors involved in Sino-US trade relations include the position of China's economy in the middle to lower end of the global value chain. There are a few Japanese and Korean-made products sent to the US included with China's exports, even though they are only assembled in China. Moreover, Washington's calculations on China imports to the US usually include cargo transported from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong, and then shipped to the US. But when calculating US exports to China, Washington uses different number crunching methods to calculate export data between the Mainland and Hong Kong. In doing so, Hong Kong finds itself excluded from the total export figures that flow from the US to China,"" the editorial says.

The Chinese state mouthpiece says that the US is obsessed with its calculation methods and ignores other factors. It says the US deliberately exaggerates the trade deficit figures because it has enough experts and experience in trade to realise the distortion in the trade figures.

""China is, and always will be, confident enough to face any challenge. If the Chinese market became more conservative for US companies, giants like GM and Apple would be affected the most as they highly depend on Chinese subsidies to increase sale,"" the editorial warns."

Edited excerpts:

Everyone said beware of the ides of March and it did turn out to be volatile. Going forward, what is your stance on the equity markets? Are we going to see a lot of consolidation or deep gashes with a negative undertone?

Last year, we saw the markets giving a return of around 28-29%. This year, the market is going to be volatile and we have seen that in the last few months as well. This volatility is coming more from global cues. There is a lot of uncertainty as to what is happening on the trade tariff side, what is happening on the monetary tightening side, so there is lot of global cues which have cause that volatility.

Having said that, last year we had very good macros. and what was actually the earnings growth that was being alluded to? This year, the earnings growth is coming back. We expect 19-20% growth in earnings this financial year, based on which, the valuations today stand at around 18 times, which is not very expensive. Considering that the growth is going to be 20% odd and PE multiple is around 18 times, you have a PEG of less than one which makes it an attractive market for medium to long term.

In the next six to nine months, you could have some choppiness in the markets because of global cues. We have major elections coming up in four states at the end of the year or beginning early next year. Plus, there are general elections next year. It is going to be a very volatile market until then.

We have not seen the kind of price erosion or value destruction in index stocks like ICICI Bank NSE -0.46 % and Tata Motors NSE -0.24 % that we have seen in the last 52 weeks. What are the issues that are ailing these two stocks? We all know the recent ones for ICICI Bank but in terms of structural core business, do you think names like these will start offering value once again?

While I will not be able to comment on stock specifics, the banking industry per se has been plagued with NPA issue. That has been plaguing both the private sector and the public sector banks. Clearly that is one of the major reasons why the stocks have underperformed. As far as auto segment is concerned, it has done reasonably well but probably in Europe the performance has not been up to the mark for various reasons. But with the kind of correction that has happened in these stocks, auto stocks are now beginning to look attractive and probably from a long-term perspective they do offer value.

The rural theme has been a much discussed big market theme. It is a very large theme and includes consumers, rural centric lenders, tractor companies, seed companies and fertiliser companies. Almost 100-150 companies come under the rural theme. What are your thoughts, how potent is this theme and what is its longevity?

It was the urban consumption theme that was playing out a year ago and the rural piece was missing. For the last two years, monsoon has been good and therefore one started to see some recovery in rural consumption last year which will continue this year.

A lot of focus of the government is on rural infrastructure in the budget. There is a focus of the government on doubling farm income in the next couple of years also and that augurs well. The focus on MSPs would be raised this June for the kharif crop and that itself would also provide a good boost to the rural incomes.

Clearly, we are very bullish on the rural theme and we believe that the consumption story is going to continue to do well because of the rural theme that is playing out. We like sectors like auto, FMCG and private banking which are a play on the consumption theme.

Another sector that I believe you all are bullish on is the overall infrastructure bet. Which kind of companies within the infrastructure space would be bullish on and what would you look at in terms of a business model for these companies?

The infrastructure spend by the government has been quite robust in the last couple of years. Last financial year, NHAI awarded 7,400 km of roads and that was a record in the last seven, eight years. We are seeing a lot of pick up in the order book of some of the private sector companies.

The EPC companies have good order books because of the growth in infrastructure. We particularly like this space in defence infrastructure. We like transmission and distribution companies, we like the plays on metros, we like the plays on roads.

The metros are getting financed by international agencies. In Bombay Metro, the Trans Harbour Link has been financed by Japanese international financing agencies. Infrastructure financing is looking at avenues other than government spending. Infrastructure as a space will drive growth going forward.

Capital goods is another space where we have seen a pretty strong finish in order inflows for some of the key companies. Do you think large cap capital goods space is a sweet spot now?

Yes. There is a lot of thrust on infrastructure and considering that, we also have elections coming up and there would be more spend from the governments -- both state as well as the central government. A lot of projects will take off and there will be a lot of thrust on infrastructure per se. We expect even the capital good companies to benefit from this and have good order books.

If one were to look at PSU space from the standpoint of valuations and robustness of business or books, compared to the entire sector, are there some names which stand out? Can we tick the entire PSU bank space with the same brush or are there areas which are relatively better off than others?

We thought that the worst for the PSUs might be behind us because the recap bonds were coming in and NPAs were being recognised. Even the 10-year G-Sec yield which had been gone up significantly and the treasury losses in the last quarter were taken care of.

But things changed dramatically because of the scam that came in and because of the RBI circular in February which said that you had to recognise NPAs much faster. Also, the 10-year yields moved up significantly though now they have corrected and that has given some respite.

But overall, the PSU space has been struggling and it has impacted all PSU banks. Within the PSU space also, there are good banks and there are those which are relatively better and there are some which have probably not done as well.

There would clearly be some standouts even in the PSU space and we are going with those banks which are relatively better as far as the asset quality and balance sheets are concerned.

You spoke of sectors that you are bullish on but what is it that you are looking at in this kind of a fall? How does one really cushion the volatility? Would you lean towards defensives as well?

Yes, a volatile market is typically not a top down kind of a market. It is more of a stock pickers’ market. You have to be very selective in the kind of stocks that you are picking up. You have to look at strong balance sheets, strong cash flows and you have to look at companies which have good growth potential and are available at reasonable valuations.

More stock specific decisions will be taken in a volatile market rather than just a sectoral approach. Some sectors do perform well in a volatile market. For example, IT has outperformed in this entire fall and we continue to think that the sector continues to outperform for the rest of the year as well.

Yes, there is a shift towards IT, FMCG and ideally even pharma is a defensive sector but because of the peculiar problems that are plaguing the pharma sector, it has not actually played out the way it should have. But yes, it is more of a stock pickers market and it will be better to play stocks rather than just sectors."

The consultations would be held under the aegis of World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism.

Special secretary level officer from the commerce ministry will lead the team.

The US is expected to seek more details about the export incentives by India, the government official said.

Last month, the US has dragged India to the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism over export subsidies, saying that these incentives were harming American companies.

America has challenged India's export subsidy programmes such as Merchandise Exports from India Scheme in the WTO, asserting that these initiatives harm its companies by creating an uneven playing field.

They had sought consultations with India under the aegis of the global trade body's dispute settlement mechanism.

Seeking consultation under the aegis of the WTO is the first step of dispute settlement process.

If the two nations are not able to reach a mutually agreed solution through consultation, the US may request for a WTO dispute settlement panel to review the matter.

The US in its statement said that thousands of Indian companies are receiving benefits totalling over USD 7 billion annually under various export promotion programmes.

Export subsidy programmes: the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme; Export Oriented Units Scheme and sector specific schemes, including Electronics Hardware Technology Parks Scheme; SEZ; Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme; and duty free imports have been challenged by US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer.

These export subsidy programmes harm American workers by creating an uneven playing field on which they must compete, the USTR had said.

According to another government official, the US has dragged India under Article 27 of WTO's Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, which also provides for special and differential treatment to developing countries.

At the time the agreement came into force, developing countries with over USD 1,000 per capita gross national income (GNI) were provided a period of eight years to bring down their export subsidies.

India has stated that the WTO informed the country only in 2017 that it has crossed this threshold and hence should get the eight-year period from 2017 to cut its exports subsidies.

India has also submitted a paper in WTO in 2011 seeking clarification with regard to the year of applicability of the provision and also the extension period.

Under the pact, developing countries can seek further extension of the eight years grace period by providing cogent arguments.

India's exports to the US stood at USD 42.21 billion in 2016-17, while imports aggregated at USD 22.30 billion during the same fiscal."

""If it is a major offensive, we are more than prepared and we are prepared defensively and we are prepared offensively,"" the BSF chief said.

Sharma said, ""I would like to make one thing clear that we 'never' initiate such violations and it is the other side which starts as a result of which we have to retaliate and react."".

The BSF DG said the sole aim of these unprovoked firing incidents on the border is to ""push"" in militants into India.

While India wants to maintain peace and does not want to create any problems on the border, it is their (Pakistan's) state policy to ""destabilise our country"", the 1982-batch IPS officer of the Rajasthan cadre said.

""They (Pakistan) are still smarting under the defeat of 1971 which led to the creation of Bangladesh and the ISI (Pakistan intelligence agency) was created with the sole objective of dividing India.

""Their first attempt was in Khalistan and they failed. Now, they are trying it in Kashmir and they will fail,"" Sharma said.

The BSF had launched three special operations 'Rustam' (2016), 'Arjun' (2017) and 'Bheem' this year, as part of its 'muh-tod jawab' (befitting reply) strategy on the border and to mount at least ""three to four times"" extra shelling on the Pakistani side and cause heavy damage to men and assets across the border.

According to data of the central security agencies, the BSF retaliation, during the operation 'Bheem' launched between January 3-24, claimed the lives of eight-ten Pakistan Rangers personnel, injured about 15-16 while about 24 civilians were killed and 65 others injured.

In comparison, three BSF personnel were killed, 17 were injured while eight civilians died and 55 were injured during the same time period due to unprovoked firing and shelling by the Pakistan side.

""But, when we react, we do that in a very befitting manner and we give them a very solid reply because since my taking over (in February, 2016) three major engagements have taken place with Pakistan.

""In all the three, we have come on top as there has been more damage in terms of men, material (on the other side). So, consequently the other side should abstain and restrain from any such activity in future but unfortunately it is their state policy to keep the issue of Jammu and Kashmir alive,"" Sharma said.

""They (militants or terrorists) are coming from the Line of Control in the last years and there has not been any infiltration from the IB side. But, they keep on trying on the IB side also,"" he said."
986,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 04:39 PM IST",PTI,Politics,"Database has minimal info on Aadhaar holders; no financial, health details: UIDAI","NEW DELHI: The UIDAI today said it does not have information about bank accounts, health records, or financial and property details of Aadhaar holders, and ""will never have"" such details in its database.

The Aadhaar-issuing body said that its database contains only minimum details of the biometric ID holders, including select demographic information.

Seeking to dispel any possible misgivings about UIDAI ever tracking activities of individuals with the data it has, the authority said, ""rest assured, UIDAI does not have your information about bank accounts, shares, mutual funds, financial and property details, health records, family, caste, religion and education etc and will never have this information in its database"".

In a public outreach, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) issued detailed FAQs or Frequently Asked Questions in national dailies, where it addressed about a dozen queries pertaining to concerns over data safety, profiling, and Aadhaar's link with bank accounts and mobile numbers.

Citing the Aadhaar Act, UIDAI said that its provisions specifically prohibit it from controlling, collecting, keeping or maintaining any information about the purpose of authentication either on its own or through any entity.

""Aadhaar is an identifier, not a profiling tool,"" it reiterated.

The move comes at a time when the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the Aadhaar Act and the use of biometric identifier in various government and non-government services.

UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey last month made a presentation in the Supreme Court to defend the government's ambitious Aadhaar scheme.

UIDAI further said that it uses ""advanced security technologies"" to safeguard data and also keeps upgrading them to meet new security threats and challenges.

Stating that Aadhaar has armed the common man with a credible identity, UIDAI claimed that the 12-digit biometric identifier today ""inspires more confidence and trust than any other identity document in India"".

It has also clarified that denial of services for lack of Aadhaar or failure of verification for technical reasons, should immediately be brought to the notice of the higher authorities in the departments concerned, and termed denials of such nature as ""unlawful"".

The UIDAI said that linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts would help weed out accounts being operated by fraudsters, criminals and money launderers.

Moreover, it would benefit the Aadhaar holder directly as a verified bank account would lead to secure banking, and prevent frauds.

It went on to argue that Aadhaar number alone does not make it possible for someone to hack an account and said the ""bank account is safe if you dont part with your PIN/OTP (One Time password) given by banks"".

Similarly, it said that verification of mobile numbers with the biometric identifier would help weed out numbers that are being operated by fraudsters, and criminals.

""It has been found that most criminals and terrorists get SIM cards issued in fictitious name and even real people without their knowledge and use them in committing frauds and crime,"" UIDAI said."

Mobile Internet was suspended across Valley for two days, however services have been restored in Srinagar, Budgam and few parts of north Kashmir on Tuesday.

Joint Hurriyat leadership led by Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik had called for strike from Sunday till Tuesday and urged people to march towards Shopian on April 4. J&K government ordered closure of all schools and colleges across Valley and postponed examination and class work till Tuesday.

Some of the relatives and locals of Kangan accompanying Gowhar at SKIMS, claim that doctors were misleading them since last evening.

“Nobody was coming clear on his condition. We have been denied information and many of them are giving us confusing remarks.

Doctors informed Majid that his son has to undergo several operations and may need a at least nine pints of blood during one surgery.

According to PTI, Income Tax Department has issued notice to Deepak Kochhar in connection with the Videocon bank loan case.

ICICI Bank NSE -0.51 % chief executive Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar is the founder & CEO of NuPower Renewables.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary enquiry into the allegations that Videocon group paid money to NuPower Renewables in lieu of a loan sanctioned by ICICI Bank. Both the bank and Dhoot have denied the allegations.

A whistle-blower has alleged that Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot provided crores of rupees to NuPower Renewables, promoted by Deepak Kochhar and two relatives, six months after Videocon group got Rs 3,250 crore as loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. The amount was part of the Rs 40,000-crore loan that Videocon group secured from a consortium of 20 banks led by SBI. Dhoot allegedly gave Rs 64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. It is alleged that he transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for Rs 9 lakh six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank

""NuPower, one of the leading Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in the renewable energy sector, has nearly 700 MW of renewable energy assets operating and in pipeline located across Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh & Madhya Pradesh.

In a series of tweets, Shah reached out to the community, which has been protesting against the Supreme Court order on the law on atrocities against SC/ST, and sought to turn the tables on the Congress by raking up its treatment to Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar.

He also blamed ""vested interest groups"" for spreading the panic on the issue of reservation for Dalits, saying it is done before every election and asserted that the government will do everything to protect their rights.

Right from the day the apex court gave its judgment on the SC/ST atrocities act, the central government acted in an ""immediate and informed"" manner and has filed an effective review petition to protect the Dalits' rights, Shah said.

He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met MPs belonging to the Scheduled Castes and had assured them that the government was doing everything to protect the rights and wellbeing of ""our Dalit sisters and brothers.""

Through the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill, 2015, the NDA government had actually strengthened the provisions of the Act and this was in line with the BJP's commitment to the welfare of the SC & ST communities, he said.

""Due to the politically driven manifestations of a microscopic minority of dejected and rejected political parties, crores of innocent people suffered. These parties owe our Dalit sisters and brothers an apology for their misdeeds,"" he said.

Shah, whose party has often accused the opposition of fuelling unfounded campaign against it before elections, said the script had now become old and that vested interest groups started spreading panic about reservations before polls.

The BJP is locked in a keen fight with the Congress in the Karnataka assembly elections, scheduled for May 12.

""The BJP's stand is clear, which I am once again stating - we fully believe in the Constitution given by Babasaheb and the rights it has given to the SC/ST communities. At every juncture and in all possible ways, the BJP stands shoulder to shoulder with the Dalit community,"" he said.

The Modi government's commitment to fulfilling Ambedkar's vision was unwavering and all its efforts were aimed at transforming the lives of Dalits, Shah claimed.

Attacking the Congress for ""mocking"" Modi's DNA, he said the party had defeated Ambedkar in Lok Sabha polls twice and made ""flimsy excuses"" to ensure his portrait was not placed in Parliament's Central Hall.

Congress also denied him a Bharat Ratna, he said, claiming that India had seen through its negative politics.

Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had said in a tweet that the the DNA of the BJP and RSS was anti-Dalit.

Shah said, ""We will continue our efforts to make our Dalit sisters and brothers the makers of New India. We will fulfill their aspirations and dreams. Jai Bhim! Jai Hind!"""

999,"Last Updated: Apr 03, 2018, 05:03 PM IST",ET Online,Not Available,Will auto sector bring Modi some respite from India's raging job crisis?,"NEW DELHI: Recently, the railways received more than two crore applications for about one lakh vacancies. So many people chasing so few low-level government jobs points out that there is a dearth of jobs in the private sector and people fall back on government jobs due to uncertainty in the jobs market.

Job creation has become a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he has only one year left to face the people in Lok Sabha polls in 2019. He had promised to create 10 million jobs a year during his campaign for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The labour ministry’s figures released on March 12 show India added 136,000 workers across eight sectors between July to October 2017. However, in the week ended Feb. 25, India’s jobless rate rose to 6.1 per cent compared to 5 per cent in January, the highest monthly rate in the past 15 months, according to the data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed.

Amid the crisis of jobs all over the economy, one sector stands out as a ray of hope—the auto industry.

India’s automobile industry just had its best fiscal year with data from manufacturers showing all-time high sales across segments. Analysts expect the momentum to continue in the new financial year, as economic activity is improving as well. Cumulative domestic vehicle sales growth in the past year was 13-15%, hitting the double-digit mark for the first time since fiscal 2012.

According to industry experts, there are several reasons behind this spike in sales — introduction of GST, which resulted in free movement of goods; crackdown on overloaded vehicles; increased investment in infrastructure; efficiency improvement in load carrying, especially by the ecommerce segment; increase in last-mile connectivity in hundreds of cities and towns; and pent-up demand and deferred purchase due to demonetisation, GST implementation and new emission regulations.

The commercial vehicle segment, seen as a barometer of economic activity, is estimated to have recorded sales of over 8.8 lakh units in the past fiscal year, growing 23% from the year before, with medium and heavy vehicles eclipsing the previous peak posted in FY12

The two-wheeler, three-wheeler and commercial vehicle segments have each posted record double-digit growth, despite uncertainty over the implementation of GST and transition to new emission standards. In passenger vehicles, the industry is projecting a high-single-digit expansion for fiscal 2018. The local two-wheeler market is estimated to have crossed the 20-million-unit milestone, with sales growing 14%, helped by strong demand in the rural areas after good rains last monsoon. The three-wheeler output (domestic and exports combined) likely ended the year close to the 1-million mark, with growth of more than 25%.



The Indian automobile sector is set to witness a pickup in hiring over the next 12 months, largely driven by the passenger vehicle segment which has seen many launches in the last year, in addition to the advent of new technologies in areas such as electrified and driverless vehicles. A recent study carried out by HR services firm PeopleStrong predicts the automobile industry to hire 8-12% more employees in fiscal 2019.

Maruti NSE 0.33 % Suzuki and Tata Motors, India’s top two vehicle makers, will together add as many as 4,500 employees this fiscal year to deal with their growing product portfolio and sales. A Tata Motors spokesperson said hiring at Tata Motors was largely for replacement last year, but this year it was much higher and incremental in order to manage growth.

A bulk of the hiring will be concentrated in the research and development (R&D) segment with a lot of it happening in areas of design, engine and fuel side, says the study. The R&D segment will see a 12-15% increase in fiscal 2019 in hiring."
